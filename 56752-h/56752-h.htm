<p>Dan Vinton returned to Yardley after the
Christmas vacation on an afternoon of one of
those bright, warm days which sometimes happen
along in the middle of Winter. As the train
rumbled over the bridge, Dan caught a fleeting
glimpse of Long Island Sound sparkling in the
sunlight and pricked out here and there with a
white sail. On his way up the winding road to
the school—he had the station carriage to himself
save for the unobtrusive presence of a homesick
Preparatory Class boy—he saw clean russet
meadows aglow in the mellow light, and, farther
inland and across the little river, Meeker’s Marsh
a broad expanse of reeds and grass and rushes
shading from green-gold to coppery red. So far,
although it was the third of January, there had
been no snow storm worthy of the name in the
vicinity of Wissining, and, save that the trees
were bare of leaves, one might have thought himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
in Autumn. It was as though a careless,
laughing October day had lost its place in the
procession and now, after a two months’ truancy,
had squirmed and crowded itself back into line
again. Dan cast a glance toward the athletic
field, half expecting to see the brown footballs
hurtling up against the sky.</p>

<p>The carriage skirted The Prospect and began
the steep ascent which ends with the plateau on
which the school buildings stand. A freight
train rumbled by through the cut a few rods below
and Dan watched the white steam as it
wreathed upward until a movement by the boy
in the farther corner of the carriage drew his attention.
The lad was digging a gloved knuckle
into his eye, his head averted in an effort to hide
the threatening tears. Dan smiled. But the
next moment, as he recalled how near to tears
he had himself been on more than one occasion
only some four months previous, the smile disappeared
and he leaned forward.</p>

<p>“Well, kid, glad to get back?” he asked kindly.</p>

<p>The lad—he looked to be no more than twelve
years of age—turned and glanced at the questioner
shyly, bravely trying to summon a smile as
he shook his head.</p>

<p>“Oh, well, you will be in a day or two,” responded
Dan heartily. “What’s your name?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>“Merrow, sir.”</p>

<p>“Well, buck up, Merrow; and never mind the
‘sir.’ I dare say you chaps are pretty comfortable
in Merle, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, s—, yes, Mr. Vinton.”</p>

<p>“Oh, so you know me, do you?” laughed Dan.
The boy nodded and smiled bashfully.</p>

<p>“I guess every fellow knows you,” he murmured.</p>

<p>“Well, don’t call me Mister, please. Where
do you live when you’re at home?”</p>

<p>“Germantown, Pennsylvania, s—, I mean—”</p>

<p>“Well, that isn’t very far away, is it?” asked
Dan cheerfully.</p>

<p>“N—no, not so very,” replied the other doubtfully.</p>

<p>“I should say not. I dare say you left home
only three or four hours ago, eh?”</p>

<p>“Twelve o’clock.”</p>

<p>“Well, I started yesterday afternoon,” said
Dan. “I had to come all the way from Ohio.
That beats you, doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>The younger boy nodded. Then:</p>

<p>“We have a fellow in our house who comes
from California,” he announced proudly.</p>

<p>“And that beats me,” laughed Dan. “Well,
here we are.” He took up his bag and clambered
out. “Come over and see me this evening,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
Merrow, if you get too lonesome; 28 Clarke’s
my room. Cheer up.”</p>

<p>He left his bag on the steps of Oxford while
he sought the office to register.</p>

<p>“Back early,” said Mr. Forisher, the secretary.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” answered Dan. “We’ve got some
dandy snow out our way and I thought I’d better
start early in case the trains got tied up. Not
many fellows back yet, are there?”</p>

<p>“Only a few. The next train will bring most
of them. Nice weather we’re having.”</p>

<p>Dan agreed that it was and turned toward the
door. But:</p>

<p>“By the way, Vinton,” said the secretary, “you
have a new roommate with you this term, I believe?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, Gerald Pennimore.”</p>

<p>“Exactly. Well—er—we want to make young
Pennimore’s stay with us as pleasant as possible,
Vinton, and so—anything you can do to—er—smooth
the way for him will be—er—appreciated
at the Office.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. I’m going to try and look out for
him, sir.”</p>

<p>“That’s right. I suppose he will be along
pretty soon.”</p>

<p>“He and his father are coming on the six<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
o’clock, sir. I had a letter from him a couple of
days ago.”</p>

<p>“Ah, that reminds me, Vinton! Mr. Collins
left word that you were to join Mr. Pennimore
and his son at the Doctor’s table this evening.
He thought that would make it pleasant for the
boy.”</p>

<p>Dan smiled as he closed the Office door behind
him.</p>

<p>“It pays to be a millionaire,” he thought. “I
rather wish, though, for Gerald’s sake, that his
father wasn’t coming along. The sooner the fellows
forget that Gerald’s John T’s son the better
it’s going to be for Gerald.”</p>

<p>He rescued his bag and made his way to Clarke
Hall where he climbed two flights of well-worn
stairs and let himself into a corner room on the
front of the building. There he sat down his
bag, threw off his hat and coat and, crossing to
the windows, sent them screeching upward. The
sun had passed from the front of the building but
a thin shaft of amber light entered the side window
and fell upon the bare top of the chiffonier
nearby. Dan thrust his hands into his pockets
and looked about him. Then he shook his head.</p>

<p>“It’s going to be funny here at first without
Tubby,” he muttered. “Tubby wasn’t what
you’d call an ideal roommate, but I was sort of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
getting used to him. I suppose a fellow misses
even a boil if he has it long enough!”</p>

<p>Twenty-eight Clarke was a large room, well
lighted and airy. It was comfortably if plainly
furnished. Each side of the room held its bed,
chiffonier, washstand and chair. An ingrain
carpet covered most of the floor and the shallow
bay window was fitted with a window-seat piled
with cushions. In the center of the room stood
a broad-topped study table and a comfortable
arm-chair flanked it at either side. On the clean
gray-tinted walls hung a few good pictures.
There was a good-sized closet on each side of the
door. Being in a corner room there was an end
window as well as the bay in front.</p>

<p>Dan hung his gray overcoat and derby hat in
the closet, swung his bag to the table and began
to unpack it. And while he is engaged let us
have a good look at him.</p>

<p>Dan Vinton was fifteen years of age, rather
tall, lithe, and long of limb. He had a quickness
and certainty of movement—exhibited even in
the way in which he stowed his things away—that
impressed the observer at once. Alertness
was a prominent characteristic of Dan’s; he never
shilly-shallied, nor, on the other hand, was he especially
impulsive. He had the faculty of making
up his mind quickly, and, his decision once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
reached, he acted promptly and with little loss of
effort. Dan’s course between two points was always
a straight line. All this may have had
something to do with the fact that he played an
extremely good game of football at the end of the
line.</p>

<p>I don’t want to give the impression that Dan
was one of the thin and nervous sort; on the contrary
he was well-built, if a trifle large for his
fifteen years, while his limbs were not all bone
even if they were long. And nerves were things
that never bothered him. He was good-looking,
with steady brown eyes, a short, straight nose,
brown hair, and a pleasant mouth which hinted of
good temper. Dan had entered Yardley Hall
School the preceding Fall and was in the Third
Class. He had won a place for himself on the
football eleven and had scored the winning touchdown
in the final contest against Yardley’s rival,
Broadwood Academy. One cannot ordinarily do
a thing like that without becoming pretty well
known in a school of some two hundred and
seventy students or without gaining some degree
of popularity, and Dan was no exception. He
had received enough praise and adulation to have
turned a less well-balanced head. To Dan the
School’s homage had brought pleasure but not
pride. He had many acquaintances but only a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
handful of friends. But the friends were worth
having and the friendship was real.</p>

<p>Having emptied the bag he tossed it onto the
closet shelf and wandered to the window, glancing
at his watch on the way.</p>

<p>“Ten minutes to five,” he murmured. “That
train ought to be in.” At that moment there was
a shriek from a locomotive whistle and Dan threw
open one of the front windows and craned his
head and shoulders out. It was just possible to
see the corner of the station, nearly a half-mile
away, and there was the big engine puffing black
smoke clouds from its diminutive stack. A moment
later it had taken up its journey again and
Dan watched it and the ten cars slip across the
open track and plunge into the long cut through
the school grounds below The Prospect. It
would be ten minutes at least before the carriages
would arrive, and Dan settled himself in his arm-chair
and took up a book. But the arrival of
his trunk from the station interrupted him a moment
later, and after the porter had gone he decided
to do his unpacking now and get it over
with. The trunk was only a small one and didn’t
keep him busy very long, but before he had finished
the carriages had begun to unload their
noisy passengers at the front of Oxford Hall and
Dan decided to finish his task before seeking his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
friends. So it was nearly a quarter of an hour
later that he set his cap onto the back of his head
and ran down the stairs. The station carriages
were making their second trips and the front of
Oxford was sprinkled with fellows. Dan returned
salutations here and there without stopping
as he cut around the corner of Clarke and
made his way to Dudley.</p>

<small>IN 7 DUDLEY</small></h2>
</div>


<p>There was no need to knock at the door of
Number 7, for the portal was wide open and
Loring and Dyer and a third person whom Dan
didn’t know were in plain sight. Dan stood for
an instant in the doorway, but for an instant
only, for Alf Loring caught sight of him, gave
a shout, hurdled a suit-case and dragged him into
the room.</p>

<p>“Hello, you old chump!” he cried. “When
did you get here? We looked all through the
train for you. How are you? Isn’t it great to
get back again? I want you to know my brother
Herb. Herb’s going to stay over night with us.
Herb, this is Dan Vinton.”</p>

<p>Dan shook hands with the elder brother and
with Tom Dyer, Loring’s roommate. Dyer only
said “Hello, Dan,” in his slow, quiet way, but his
hand-clasp and the smile that accompanied it said
a lot more. Alf Loring talked on breathlessly as
he threw bags out of the way and told everyone
to find a seat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>“Herb’s on his way to New Haven, Dan. He’s
coming here in the Fall to help turn out the dandiest
team old Yardley’s ever had, aren’t you,
Herb?”</p>

<p>“Maybe,” answered his brother smilingly.
“If you fellows want me.”</p>

<p>“Of course we want you!” cried Alf. “What
have I been telling you all along?”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know how your coach would like
it, Kid. He may not want anyone butting in.”</p>

<p>“Payson? Don’t you believe it! Payson’s a
dandy chap, Herb; he’ll be pleased to death
to have someone take a hand. Won’t he, Dan?”</p>

<p>“I should think he ought to be,” Dan replied.
“Especially a man like Mr. Loring.”</p>

<p>The Yale man acknowledged the compliment
with a nod and a laugh. “I don’t know much
about coaching, though,” he said. “I’ve never
tried it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, you know how to play football,”
said Alf, “and that’s more than some coaches
do. You’ll be all right. With me to help you,”
he added as an afterthought. At which they
all laughed, even Dyer. Herbert Loring was a
big, broad-chested, handsome fellow who looked
a little bit spoiled. He was in his junior year at
Yale and was one of the star half-backs. It was
evident that Alf thought this big brother a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
fine and important person, and equally evident
that big brother wasn’t denying it. But in spite
of the fact that he seemed a trifle too well pleased
with himself, Dan quite liked him.</p>

<p>For a time the talk dwelt on football, football
past and future, football at Yale, and football at
Yardley. Tom Dyer’s part in the discussion was
slight, he preferring to get his bag unpacked and
his things put away. But it was Tom who finally
switched the conversation away from football.</p>

<p>“That protegé of yours shown up yet, Dan?”
he asked, pausing on his way to the closet with
a pair of shoes in each hand.</p>

<p>“Not yet. He and his father are coming on
the six o’clock train, I believe.”</p>

<p>“By Jove!” exclaimed Alf. “I’d forgotten all
about Little Lord Fauntleroy. Poor old Dan!”</p>

<p>“Who’s Little Lord Fauntleroy?” asked Herbert
Loring.</p>

<p>“Dan’s new roommate and protegé. I told
you about him, don’t you remember?” Big
Brother shook his head and taking one knee into
his clasped hands leaned back comfortably against
the cushions of the window-seat.</p>

<p>“No, you didn’t, Kid. Who is he? Let’s hear
about him.”</p>

<p>“It’s all just like a story in a book,” said Alf,
with a grin at Dan. “It happened last Fall.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
You know who John T. Pennimore is, don’t
you?”</p>

<p>“The man they call the Steamship King? He
lives around here, doesn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Yes, you can see his place from out front.
Sound View he calls it; and it’s a dandy; there’s
eight acres of it, with a regular palace of a house,
stables, kennels, gardener’s lodge, hot-houses, and
all that sort of thing. They say he’s worth a
hundred millions.”</p>

<p>“They say a whole lot of rot,” said his brother
witheringly. “He probably has ten or fifteen
millions.”</p>

<p>“Is that all?” murmured Tom. “Wonder how
he lives!”</p>

<p>“Well, anyhow, he’s rich, all right. And he’s
done two or three things for the school, they say;
given money, I suppose; shouldn’t wonder if he
owned some stock in it. Does he, do you think,
Dan?”</p>

<p>“I never heard him say anything about it,”
Dan replied. Herbert Loring looked across at
him with surprise and interest.</p>

<p>“Do you know him?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Know him?” scoffed Alf. “Why, they’re as
thick as thieves, aren’t you, Dan? I wouldn’t be
surprised if they called each other by their first
names.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, where’s the story?” asked his brother
impatiently.</p>

<p>“Coming right along. John T. has one son,
a kid of about—how old, Dan? Fourteen? Yes.
And of course the old gentleman thinks a whole
lot of him. Well, one day last Fall our hero—”
with a bow to Dan—“was walking through the
woods to the beach by the path that leads along
John T’s fence when he heard a dickens of a
yowling; sounded like a dog having its tail cut
off. So our hero investigates.”</p>

<p>“Cut out the ‘hero’ business,” begged Dan.</p>

<p>“Pardon me! Mr. Vinton investigates and
finds that on the other side of the fence is a play-house
and that the dog is shut up in the play-house
and that the play-house is on fire. I say,
Dan, it’s always been a mystery to me how that
thing got on fire.”</p>

<p>“It was funny,” responded Dan carelessly.</p>

<p>“Well, anyhow,” continued Alf, “Dan climbs
the fence and finds this young Pennimore kid,
breaking into the house with an axe to rescue
the dog. He tries to make him behave but the
kid insists on rescuing Fido. So in he goes. By
that time the house is full of flames and smoke
and such things. Dan waits a minute and the
kid doesn’t come out again. Then Dan ties a
handkerchief around his mouth, girds up his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
loins and dashes into the seething cauldron—”</p>

<p>“That’s water,” interrupted Tom disgustedly.
“You mean ‘the sea of flames.’”</p>

<p>“All right, Tom; dashes into the sea of flames
and pulls out the kid and the dog, too, and gets
nicely baked in the process.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” said Dan. “I only got a couple
of little burns on my leg and arm.”</p>

<p>“Who’s telling this story?” demanded Alf.
“You dry up! Well, old John T. comes along
with some of his servants and finds them and
takes them up to the house and has them put to
bed and gets the doctor for them. Whether he
offered Dan half his kingdom I don’t know;
Dan’s awfully tight with his details; but I’ll bet
he could have had anything he’d wanted, say half
a dozen steamships. John T. keeps him at his
house until noon next day, sends word to Toby,
that’s our Principal here, you know, that Dan’s
made a jolly hero of himself and that he isn’t to
be licked for staying away from school. Of
course the kid’s grateful, too, and between them
they come pretty near spoiling little Daniel; automobile
rides, trips on John T’s big ocean yacht,
dinners and luncheons and all the rest of it!
Oh, Dan’s the whole works at Sound View!”</p>

<p>“Bully for you!” laughed Herbert Loring with
a glance of admiration at Dan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>“But the best part of the story is to come,”
said Alf. “Old Toby has always been eager to
get John T. to send his son to school here; he’s
been after the boy on the quiet for a couple of
years; but John T. was afraid something might
happen to little Gerald if he got up here with all
us great rough rowdies—”</p>

<p>“Come now, Alf, that’s a whopper,” interrupted
Dan warmly. “You can’t blame Mr.
Pennimore, I think, for being soft over the boy.
His wife’s dead and Gerald’s all he’s got to be
fond of.”</p>

<p>“That and fifteen millions,” muttered Tom
gravely.</p>

<p>“Well, anyhow, he wouldn’t think of it. Had
a private tutor for Gerald and watched him every
minute. Broadwood Academy wanted to get the
kid, too, Herb. I guess that’s one reason Toby
wanted him here; we always like to get ahead
of Broadwood, you know. Well, to make a long
story short, as they say, Dan has the cheek to
tell John T. that if he wants to make a man out
of his boy the only thing to do is to send him to
Yardley. And John T. thinks it over awhile and
finally agrees to do it if Dan will take Gerald to
room with him and look after him; warm his
milk for him and cover him up at night, and all
that sort of thing, you know. And now the question<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
before the meeting is; Who is the joke on?”</p>

<p>“I should say it was on Vinton,” laughed his
brother. “I’m afraid you’re in for a hard time
of it.”</p>

<p>“You ought to know better than to believe all
Alf tells you,” replied Dan untroubledly. “Mr.
Pennimore didn’t ask me to let Gerald room with
me. That was my idea. My roommate had left
school and I thought I might as well take Gerald
in. He’s not a milksop at all, in spite of what
Alf says. He’s been spoiled a bit, but a month
or so here will knock all that out of him. Mr.
Pennimore is as fine a man as I ever met and I’m
mighty glad to do anything for him I can. I
don’t propose to warm Gerald’s milk for him, as
Alf puts it, but I intend to be decent to him and
see that he has a fair chance. Lots of the fellows
will be down on him at the start just because he
is John T. Pennimore’s son. That isn’t fair.
He can’t help it if his father is a millionaire.
Lots of fellows here have fathers who have plenty
of money, only they’ve never been talked about
in the papers.”</p>

<p>“There’s something in that, Dan,” Alf allowed.
“Here’s Tom here. Tom’s father owns about
everything in his part of New Jersey, so they
say, but Tom isn’t half bad when you get to know
him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>Tom only smiled.</p>

<p>“Glad you think that way,” said Dan earnestly,
“for I want you two fellows to be nice to
Gerald and help me all you can.”</p>

<p>“You do, eh?” asked Alf. “Well, we’ll do it
for your sake, Dan. Bring the kid around some
time and we’ll look him over. What class is he
going into?”</p>

<p>“Fourth. He could have made the Third
easily if it hadn’t been for math.”</p>

<p>“Why doesn’t he live at home?” asked Herbert
Loring.</p>

<p>“The winter home is in New York,” Dan explained.
“Sound View is just a summer place.
Besides, Mr. Pennimore is going abroad pretty
soon for several months, I believe. That’s one
reason he was willing to let Gerald come here; he
said he guessed he’d be safer here than all alone
in New York with just the servants.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I dare say the kid isn’t as bad as Alf
makes out,” said the elder Loring. “I don’t
envy you your job, though, Vinton. If you’ll
take my advice, and I know what I’m talking
about, you’ll let him hoe his own row. I dare
say a few hard knocks are only what he needs.”</p>

<p>“And I’ll bet he will get them,” observed Tom
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“Whatever happens,” counselled Alf, “make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
him understand that he’s got to take things as
they come and that the sooner he forgets that
his dad has any money the better it’ll be for
him.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to,” answered Dan. “Or, at least,
I’m going to try. He isn’t a bad sort at all, and
I don’t want him to make a mess of things here,
especially after persuading his father to let him
come.”</p>

<p>“Well, don’t you worry,” said Alf. “We’ll
help you out all we can. I guess he will get on
all right. He must have some sense or he
wouldn’t be John T’s son!”</p>

<p>“Must be supper time,” said Tom. “Something
tells me so, and it isn’t my watch either.”</p>

<p>“That’s right, it’s five minutes after six.
Come on, fellows. I’ll find a place for you at our
table, Herb. Are you hungry?”</p>

<p>“Sort of. Well, glad to have met you, Vinton.
Come and see me if you get up to New Haven.
Alf will tell you where I live.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you’re not through with Dan yet,”
laughed Alf. “He sits at our table.”</p>

<p>“But not to-night,” replied Dan, as they went
out. “Toby’s invited me to his table. Mr. Pennimore
and Gerald will be there, you know.”</p>

<p>“Well, what do you think of that?” cried Alf.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</a><br />
<small>DAN BEGINS RIGHT</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“Well, son,” said Mr. Pennimore, “I guess
everything’s all right. You’ve got a nice, clean,
pleasant room here and Dan to keep you from
getting homesick.”</p>

<p>“They don’t put very much in the rooms, do
they?” asked Gerald Pennimore a trifle dubiously.</p>

<p>Supper was over and Mr. Pennimore and the
two boys, after a visit to the Office, had come up
to 28 Clarke. Mr. Pennimore was returning to
New York on the nine-thirty-eight train, in spite
of the fact that Doctor Hewitt, the Principal, had
pressed him to spend the night at Yardley.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t see but what you have everything
that you need,” replied Gerald’s father,
adding with a smile, “You must remember, son,
that you’re here to study and work.”</p>

<p>Mr. John T. Pennimore was about fifty-two
or -three years of age, rather under than above
average height, a very well-bred looking gentleman
with a kind if somewhat thoughtful face.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
His eyes were very black, very bright and keen.
His hair was just a little grizzled at the temples,
and he wore a dark beard, trimmed short, and a
mustache. His manners were charming and his
voice pleasant. Dan had never seen Mr. Pennimore
when he was not immaculately dressed.
He always looked, to use a familiar expression,
as though he had just stepped out of a band-box.</p>

<p>The resemblance between father and son was
not yet very striking. What there was depended
more on tricks of voice, and little mannerisms
than on looks, although when Gerald laughed the
resemblance was slightly apparent. Gerald
promised to grow into a larger man than his
father, although just at present he appeared far
from robust. He was fourteen years old, but
scarcely looked it. He was slightly built, and his
very blue eyes, pink and white skin, and corn-colored
hair gave him a somewhat girlish appearance
which of late had been troubling him
a good deal. For Gerald admired strength and
virility, and his greatest ambition was to make
a name for himself on the athletic field, an ambition
that, judging from present indications,
seemed scarcely likely to be attained.</p>

<p>Gerald’s mother had died so soon after his
birth that he couldn’t recall her at all. Since
then he had been in charge of nurses and tutors,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
had been given well-nigh everything he wanted
and had been as carefully guarded as the heir-apparent
of a throne. Mr. Pennimore had tried
hard not to spoil him, but Gerald was an only
child and it would have been strange indeed if
Mr. Pennimore had been quite successful in his
effort. Dan and Gerald had known each other
only three months but were already quite close
friends. Gerald’s liking for the older boy was
closely akin to hero worship; and the day on
which he had learned that he was to go to Yardley
Hall School and room with Dan was one of
the happiest of his life. On the other hand, Dan
liked Gerald less for what he was than for what
he believed he was capable of being. The boy
had never had a fair chance, he thought, and it
was no wonder that he was a trifle selfish and
self-centered. And as for his flat chest and weak
muscles, why, what could you expect of a boy
who had never had any real playmates and whose
most violent exercise consisted of driving in carriage
or automobile or pasting stamps in a stamp
book! Dan believed that a couple of years at
Yardley would work a change.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll have to study all right,” responded
Gerald to his father’s reminder. “It’s going to
be hard, I guess. But I don’t care,” he added
with a shy smile at Dan. “I’d a lot rather be here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
than at home studying with one of those silly old
tutors.”</p>

<p>Mr. Pennimore smiled.</p>

<p>“If it weren’t for those tutors, Gerald, you
wouldn’t be here now.” Then he turned to Dan.
“Now, Dan,” he said, “tell me what you do all
day. When I’m away I shall often be wondering
what this boy of mine is up to. Tell me
something about your life here.”</p>

<p>“Well, sir, we get up about seven and go to
Chapel at half-past,” responded Dan. “We
have prayers and Old Toby—I mean Doctor Hewitt—reads
a chapter in the Bible and Mr. Collins
reads the announcements. Then we have
breakfast at eight. I’m going to try and get
Gerald a place at our table, sir, but I’m afraid
there isn’t room.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps one of the fellows will change with
me,” suggested Gerald hopefully. But Dan
smiled and shook his head.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe so,” he answered. “It doesn’t
matter much which table you’re at, though; you
get mighty good feed everywhere. That’s one
thing Yardley’s good at, Mr. Pennimore, feeding
the fellows. They give us all we want, and
it’s good, too. Recitations begin at nine and continue
until twelve. Dinner’s at one, and then,
from two to four, there’s more recitations. At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
four there’s gymnasium for the Prep and Fourth
Class fellows. After that there’s nothing to do
except study in the evening from eight to nine.
Lots of fellows don’t do that; if you haven’t
many recitations during the day you can do most
of your studying then.”</p>

<p>“That sounds a whole lot, doesn’t it?” asked
Gerald anxiously of his father.</p>

<p>“Well, it doesn’t sound like an idle life,”
laughed Mr. Pennimore. “But I dare say it
will go smoothly enough after you’ve once got
into the routine, son. Method lightens toil.
But there’s plenty of play, I take it, Dan?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, lots. We have a mighty good time.
There are two societies, Cambridge and Oxford.
Most every fellow belongs to one or the other. I’m
going to get Gerald into Cambridge; that’s the
one I belong to; but I can’t get him in until May.”</p>

<p>“Are these secret societies?” asked Mr. Pennimore
with a trace of anxiety.</p>

<p>“No, sir, we haven’t any of those. Faculty
won’t let us. Our societies are debating clubs,
or, at least, they’re supposed to be, and we do
have debates; there’s one every Saturday night.
But they’re more social than anything else.
Both societies have nice rooms where the fellows
can get together and talk or play or read. Then,
of course, a fellow can have lots of fun out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
doors. There’s golf and hockey now, and after
awhile there’ll be baseball and tennis and other
things. And then there’s basket-ball, too; a good
many fellows go in for that.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to play baseball,” announced Gerald
decisively.</p>

<p>“Well, we will see about that,” replied his
father. “It’s a long way to Spring yet. You
keep up with your studies for a couple of months
and we will talk about baseball later.”</p>

<p>“You must see Mr. Bendix to-morrow,” said
Dan, “and take your physical examination. He
will tell you what sports you can go in for.”</p>

<p>“Does he have the say?” asked Gerald anxiously.
Dan nodded.</p>

<p>“You’d better believe he does! If he says you
can’t play baseball or football you can’t, and
that’s all there is to it. But he’s square, all
right, is ‘Muscles,’ and you want to do just as he
tells you. He’s a wonder!”</p>

<p>Gerald considered this in silence a moment.
Then:</p>

<p>“If a fellow can’t play baseball and things I
don’t see any use of coming here,” he murmured.</p>

<p>Mr. Pennimore laughed.</p>

<p>“So that’s your idea, is it, son? Well, let me
tell you that you’re here to fit yourself for college.
You wanted to come here, Gerald, and you’ve had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
your way. Now there must be no backing down,
my boy. Life isn’t all play, as you’ll find out
when you get older, but you can make it seem
like play by taking an interest in work. You
mustn’t think that because I’ve got money enough
for us both that you’re going to sit down and
twiddle your thumbs and watch the procession
go by. No, sir! You’re going to march with the
rest, and I want to see you marching at the head.
Work’s one of the best things life has to offer,
if we only realize it, and the man who loves his
work is the man who does it best and gets the
most out of life. Well, you’ll think me a tiresome
old codger if I lecture any longer. Just you
put the same amount of enthusiasm into work
that you do into play, Gerald, and you won’t have
much trouble. Now I must get down to the
station if I’m going to catch that train.”</p>

<p>“Are you going abroad soon, sir?” asked
Dan.</p>

<p>“In about two weeks. Gerald’s coming up to
town to see me a day or two before I sail, and I’d
like to have you come along, Dan, if you want to.
I sail on Tuesday. You boys might come up Friday
evening and stay until Sunday. We’ll fix it
up later with Doctor Hewitt.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir,” answered Dan. “I’d like to
come very much if I won’t be in the way. I’ve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
never been to New York except just to come into
the station and go out again.”</p>

<p>“Well, we will have to show him some of
the sights, eh, son? Take him to a theater or
two.”</p>

<p>“That’ll be fine!” cried Gerald. “Will you go,
Dan?”</p>

<p>“You bet I will, if I can get off!”</p>

<p>“I’ll write to the Doctor next week and see,”
said Mr. Pennimore. “I think I can persuade him
to let you go. Now get your cap, son, and walk a
little way with me. Good-bye, Dan. I’ll see you
in town before I sail. Keep an eye on this worthless
boy of mine and see that he writes to me
twice a week. If he doesn’t I’ll shut down on his
allowance. I guess that will bring him to terms,”
laughed Mr. Pennimore.</p>

<p>Dan went with them to the head of the stairs,
shook hands again with Mr. Pennimore and returned
to his room. Gerald’s big trunk, which
had arrived an hour before, stood in front of the
door. Dan bent over and unbuckled the strap.
It wasn’t an easy task and Dan had to put all
his strength into it. When it was done and he
had slipped down the catches he stood off and ran
his fingers through his hair in a way he had when
puzzled. Then he shook his head slowly, fastened
the catches again and, after a deal of hard work,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
restrapped the trunk, working the buckle into the
last possible hole.</p>

<p>“Might as well begin right,” he murmured
as he dropped panting into his chair and took up
a book.</p>

<p>Yardley Hall School<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> stands on a small plateau
about a half-mile from the shore, and commanding
a broad view, of Long Island Sound, about
half way between Newport and New Haven. The
Wissining River, from which small stream the
tiny village takes its name, curves around the
back of the school grounds, separating them from
the wide expanse of Meeker’s Marsh, flows beside
the village, and empties into the Sound. Across
the Wissining lies Greenburg, a considerable
manufacturing town, and beyond Greenburg and
some two miles from the water is located Yardley’s
time-honored rival, Broadwood Academy.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="noi"><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> Readers who desire a more detailed description of Yardley
Hall School are referred to Chapter V of <cite>Forward Pass</cite>, the preceding
story in this series.</p></div>

<p>There are six buildings at Yardley, most of
them quite modern; the school is not old, as New
England schools go, having been founded by Doctor
Tobias Hewitt in 1870. There is Oxford Hall,
containing the Office, the Principal’s living rooms,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
laboratories, recitation rooms, library, assembly
hall, and the rooms of the rival societies, Oxford
and Cambridge. Oxford Hall is one of the older
buildings. The other is Whitson, which elbows
it on the East and which contains the dining-room,
or commons as it is called, on the first floor, and
dormitories above. Clarke is a dormitory entirely,
as are Dudley and Merle, the latter being
reserved for the boys of the Preparatory Class.
The Kingdon Gymnasium completes the list of
buildings if one excepts the heating plant and the
boat house.</p>

<p>From the back of the gymnasium the ground
slopes down slowly to the tennis courts, the athletic
field and the river. Here, too, but further
upstream is the golf links, a nine hole course
that is well maintained and well patronized. In
front of Oxford Hall is an expanse of lawn known
as The Prospect. From this a flight of steps
leads to the lower ground and joins a path which
crosses the railroad cut by a rustic bridge and
leads to the woods beyond. Through these various
paths wind deviously to the beach and the
Sound. Between the woods, which are school property,
and at the mouth of the river, lies the Pennimore
estate, eight acres of perfectly kept lawn
and grove and shrubbery, with a long stone pier
running out into the water for the accommodation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
of the “Steamship King’s” big yacht on
which, in the summer time, he makes his trips to
and from New York.</p>

<p>From the upper floors of the Yardley buildings
one may see for miles up and down the Sound,
and even, on clear days, catch a glimpse of Montauk
Point across the water. It would, I think,
be difficult to find a finer site for a school than that
occupied by Yardley. Although still under forty
years of age, Yardley Hall has won a name for itself
in a part of the country where famous schools
are many, and you will never be able to persuade
a Yardley man to acknowledge that any other
school approaches it in excellence. As for Broadwood—well,
I never could do justice to a Yardley
man’s opinion of that institution!</p>

<p>On an afternoon about a week subsequent to
the opening of the winter term Dan dropped in
at Number 7 Dudley. The bright weather continued,
but there was no hint of Autumn in the
air to-day. A shrill east wind charged around
the corner of the building, and boys crossing the
yard kept their heads down into their collars and
their hands in their pockets and took short cuts
across the winter turf in brazen defiance of regulations.
But Number 7 was warm and cozy as
Dan closed the door behind him and tossed his
cap onto a chair. The steam pipes were sizzling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
drowsily and in the grate a bed of coals glowed
warmly.</p>

<p>“Gee,” said Dan, “I wish we had fireplaces in
Clarke.”</p>

<p>“You ought to be glad you haven’t,” answered
Alf Loring from the window-seat. “Every time
you have a fire it costs you ten cents for a hod
of coal. Tom’s always kicking about the expense.”</p>

<p>Tom Dyer, seated at the study table writing
a letter, grunted ironically without looking up.</p>

<p>“Come on over here and stretch your weary
limbs,” said Alf, cuddling his feet under him to
make room and tossing a pillow at the visitor.
Alfred Loring was seventeen years old and was
captain and quarter-back of the football team. He
was a nice, jolly looking fellow with a pair of
merry brown eyes and hair of the same shade
which he wore parted in the middle and slicked
down straightly on either side of his well-shaped
head. Alf was in the Second Class, as was his
roommate, Tom Dyer. Tom, however, was a year
older, a rangey, powerful looking youth, rather
silent, rather sleepy-looking, but good-natured to
a fault. Tom wasn’t a beauty, by any means,
but his gray eyes and his expression when he
smiled redeemed the rather heavy features. Tom
played on the Eleven at left half and had just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
been elected captain of the basket-ball team in
place of a First Class fellow who had failed to
return in the fall.</p>

<p>“Ain’t it cold?” asked Alf as Dan snuggled
against the pillow. “If this keeps up we’ll have
ice on the river in no time. Do you skate, Dan?”</p>

<p>“Not much. But I’m going to get some skates
and try it.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know whether to believe you or not,”
laughed Alf, “you’re so modest. I dare say you
can skate all around me.”</p>

<p>“No, honest, Alf, that’s the truth. I can’t
skate much. I never seemed to be able to learn.”</p>

<p>“That’s too bad. I was hoping you’d try for
the hockey team. But you get some skates and
get busy. You’d better come out for the team,
anyway. You’ll have plenty of fun, even if you
don’t make it.”</p>

<p>“And probably break my silly neck!”</p>

<p>“Well, don’t do that; we need you too much
next fall. But you might try for goal. You don’t
have to skate much to play goal.”</p>

<p>“Don’t have to do much of anything,” observed
Tom dryly, “except stand up there and be hit
with a hunk of hard rubber that feels like paving
block. I’ve tried it; played on Whitson team
two years ago. We played Clarke for the School
Championship.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>“Did you win?” asked Dan, scenting a story.</p>

<p>“No, we lost,” replied Tom, going on with his
writing.</p>

<p>“Tell him how, Tom,” said Alf with a chuckle.</p>

<p>“Dead easy,” answered Tom with a reminiscent
smile. “The first half ended three to two in our
favor and we were feeling pretty cheerful. But
when we began again one of our fellows—Nickerson—he
was playing cover-point—did something
that didn’t please the referee and got put off for
the limit; two minutes, I think it was. Then
Clarke got down to business and made things
hot around goal. I stopped about four shots in
as many seconds and then there was a mix-up
in front of the net and someone laid open my
head with his stick. When I came around again
I found they’d scored on us. I tried to go back
and play but I was too dizzy to stand up and they
made me quit and put in a sub named Baxter.
Baxter meant well, but he was so excited that he
couldn’t see straight. And along toward the end
of the half, with the score tied, Clarke rushed
the puck again and took a shot. Baxter stopped
it with foot and it got stuck between his skate
and his boot. Instead of calling for time or doing
anything sensible he just stood there and shook
his foot like a hen with mud between her toes.
Well, at about the sixth shake the puck came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
out and flew into the net. That gave Clarke one
goal to the good. We all called Baxter names,
and that got him more excited and nervous than
ever. And then, with about a minute to play the
puck came down again with everyone squabbling
over it. Baxter’s eyes just stood out of his head
and he made a dash out of goal, got the puck
somehow or other and deliberately swiped into
his own goal! Oh, he made quite a hit that day
for a sub!”</p>

<p>“I’ll bet he did!” laughed Dan. “I suppose
you fellows all loved him to death.”</p>

<p>“We did—not,” grunted Tom. “It was funny
about Baxter, though,” he added thoughtfully.
“He graduated last year, and about a month later
he was going over from New York to Boston with
his folks on that steamer that caught fire; what
was its name, Alf?”</p>

<p>“<i>Independence.</i>”</p>

<p>“Yes. The fire didn’t amount to a whole lot in
the end, but for awhile things looked a bit bad.
Well, the papers the next day made a regular hero
of Baxter. According to them he was the life of
the party. Had a fine time and enjoyed every
minute of his visit. He bossed folks around,
strapped life-preservers on fat old ladies, helped
launch the boats and was as cool as a cucumber.
It just shows that you never can tell, don’t it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>“Where is he now?” asked Dan.</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s a dead ’un now; he’s gone to Harvard,”
answered Tom.</p>

<p>“What did he want to go there for?” asked
Dan, who had already decided on Yale, quite indignantly.</p>

<p>“Search me! What does any fellow want to go
there for?”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s lucky for Yale some fellows do go,”
laughed Alf. “If they didn’t we wouldn’t have
anyone to beat!”</p>

<p>“Well, there’s something in that,” grunted
Tom. “But I’ll tell you fellows one thing, though.
Some day those Harvard Johnnies will take their
hands out of their pockets, work up a coaching
system like they have at Yale and everlastingly
wallop us for keeps!”</p>

<p>“Oh, you run away and play!” scoffed Alf.</p>

<p>“All right. You just wait and see,” replied
Tom unruffledly, returning to his letter.</p>

<p>“What’s Tom think he’s doing?” asked Dan
of Alf.</p>

<p>“He <em>thinks</em> he’s a little Hague doing the arbitration
act,” replied Alf, “but what he’s really
doing is making a mess. Rand—you know Paul
Rand?—he’s basket-ball manager, or thinks he
is. Well, he tried to make dates with Broadwood
for three games and got high and mighty and tried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
to dictate things with the result that Broadwood
refused to have anything to do with us. And I
don’t blame her. We won last year, you know,
and so Rand thought we could lay down the law.
Broadwood didn’t see it that way. So Tom is
trying to make a noise like a Dove of Peace. He’s
writing to the Broadwood captain, and I’ll bet
he gets sat on for his trouble.”</p>

<p>“That’ll be all right,” replied Tom, folding and
sealing his letter. “I’ve offered them their
choice of dates for the second game and told them
we’d play the third anywhere they liked. They’ll
come down and make terms. And when they
do—” Tom put the stamp on with a bang of his
fist—“we’ll lick them so hard that they won’t
know whether they’re coming or going!”</p>

<p>“That’s Tom’s idea of Peace!” laughed
Alf.</p>

<p>“Well,” growled his roommate, “I’ve got to
have some satisfaction for grovelling under their
feet and rubbing my head in the mud.” He
tossed the letter aside distastefully. “Say, Dan,
how’s the kid getting on?”</p>

<p>“Yes, how is little Geraldine?” asked Alf.</p>

<p>“All right,” replied Dan not very enthusiastically.
“I was going to bring him along, but he
hadn’t shown up when I left the room. I dare
say he’s gone over home.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>“Sound View?” asked Alf. “I thought the
place was closed up.”</p>

<p>“It is, but some of the servants are there, and
he’s got a dog he’s awfully fond of; the one that
’most got burned.”</p>

<p>“I heard some of the Prep kids calling him
‘Young Money-Bags’ the other day,” said Tom.
“I’m afraid he isn’t going to be popular, Dan.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see why not,” answered Dan warmly.
“He isn’t a snob by any means; doesn’t even act
like one. The fellows here wouldn’t think of looking
down on a chap because he had no money.
Why should they look down on him because he
has?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t think it’s exactly that,” mused
Alf. “The trouble is, Dan, that Toby and Collins
and the Faculty generally are so blamed proud
of him. You’d think he was a young prince.”</p>

<p>“They aren’t proud of him,” answered Dan.
“They’re proud of getting him; proud of beating
Broadwood.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s a commendable pride,” said Alf
with a yawn. “The best way to do, as Brother
Herb said the other day, is to just let him fight it
out alone. If the School finds you sticking up for
him too much they’ll take more of a grudge than
ever to him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m letting him do his own fighting right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
enough. So much so that Gerald thinks I’ve gone
back on him, and looks at me pathetically when
he thinks I don’t see him. Makes me feel sort
of like a brute, you know. He’s been a bit homesick,
too, I guess, although he hasn’t said anything
about it.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s promising,” said Alf. “Shows
he isn’t a cry-baby. Does he know anyone yet?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think so; except you fellows. It’ll
take him time, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“Bring him around here whenever you want
to,” said Tom. “I don’t mind him. I know what
it’s like to be homesick and out of it myself.”</p>

<p>“You!” exclaimed Dan.</p>

<p>“Sure! Don’t you think I’ve got any feelings?
I went to a boarding school for two years before
I struck Yardley; one of those motherly places
where they advertise a nice home life for the kids.
The first month I was there I thought I’d die.
Lonesome? Gosh, that isn’t any word for it! I
was sort of quiet and shy, I guess, and the fellows
thought I was stuck-up and left me pretty
much alone except when they picked on me.”</p>

<p>“Did you get over it?” asked Dan.</p>

<p>“Had to. I stood it until I couldn’t have
stayed there any longer and then I picked out the
biggest fellow in my class and put it up to him.
‘I’ve been here a whole month,’ I told him, ‘and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
you fellows haven’t spoken decently to me yet.’
(I was only thirteen and was half crying.)
‘You’ve either got to take some notice of me,’ I
said, ‘or fight, and I don’t care which it is.’ The
chap looked at me in a funny sort of way for a
minute, and then he laughed and clapped me on
the shoulder. ‘Fight!’ he said. ‘Why, I don’t
want to fight you, kid. You’re all right. You
come along with me.’”</p>

<p>“Well?” Dan asked eagerly.</p>

<p>“Oh, I went.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but did he—what did he do?”</p>

<p>“Nothing; just walked with me across the playground.
It was in the afternoon after school and
almost every fellow was there. That was all he
had to do. They gave me a chance after that and
I made good.”</p>

<p>“If he’d accepted your invitation and licked
you, though,” said Alf, “I don’t see that it would
have helped you much.”</p>

<p>“He wouldn’t have licked,” said Tom quietly,
“not the way I was feeling that day.”</p>

<p>“You, you old duffer,” scoffed his roommate,
“why, you couldn’t lick a postage stamp!”</p>

<p>Tom pushed his chair back, arose, and approached
Alf with a broad smile. Alf got his legs
from under him and prepared for battle. Dan
removed to a safer vantage point, and the trouble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
began. <a href="#i_fp040">It was a fine “rough-house” while it
lasted.</a> The cushions were soon on the floor and
the combatants speedily followed them, bringing
along a curtain pole and two curtains. It was
the pole that produced a cessation of hostilities.
In falling it came end first and Alf’s head happened
to be in the way. There was a yell, and
when Tom removed himself from the recumbent
form of his chum, Alf was feeling of his head disgustedly.</p>

</div>

<p>“That fool thing always does that. I’ll bet
my brain is just full of holes.”</p>

<p>“Well, there’s something the matter with it,”
laughed Tom.</p>

<p>Then they went at it again, around the study
and up against the table where the ink bottle was
upset and a portion of its contents distributed
over the letter Tom had just written.</p>

<p>“There!” gasped Tom. “Look what you’ve
done! Spoiled the stamp! And I’ll have to address
a new envelope.”</p>

<p>“You did it yourself, you clumsy brute,” answered
Alf, rearranging his attire. “But I’ll
give you another stamp. It’s worth that much to
wallop you!”</p>

<p>“Huh! A lot of walloping you did!”</p>

<p>“I made you look like thirty cents, all right.
Didn’t I, Dan?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>“I declare it a draw,” laughed Dan. “And
I’m going to get out before you do any more
damage.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t go,” begged Alf. “Wait and see
me lick him again. I’ve only just begun on him.”</p>

<p>“Huh!” Tom grunted, seating himself at the
table. “Say, Dan, wait a second, like a good
chap, and drop this in the mail for me. I’ll take
that stamp, Alf.”</p>

<p>“Haven’t got it just now. I’ll give you one
some day, though. I always pay my debts sooner
or later.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got one,” Dan offered. “Toss me the
letter.”</p>

<p>“There you are. Remind me that I owe it to
you, Dan. That was the last one I had. I can’t
keep stamps. I believe Alf must eat them.”</p>

<p>“Well!” exclaimed Alf indignantly, “I’d just
like to know who buys all the stamps that are
used in this room.”</p>

<p>“Not you, you old miser!”</p>

<p>“Tom, you must apologize for that, you really
must!”</p>

<p>“Who to? Now, look here, sonny, if you start
this again—!”</p>

<p>Dan made a hurried leap for the door and escaped
the rush.</p>

<p>“Good-bye, you fellows!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>There was no answer, but as he closed the door
behind him there came the crash of an overturned
chair. He paused, smiling, a little way down the
corridor and waited. From beyond the closed
portal of Number 7 came sounds resembling those
of a small riot. Presently Dan walked heavily
back and rapped sharply on the door. Instantly
the commotion ceased.</p>

<p>“Come in,” said a polite voice.</p>

<p>Dan opened the door. Alf, breathing heavily,
was reading on the window-seat and Tom was
seated in a corner nonchalantly nursing one knee.</p>

<p>“What’s all this noise I hear?” asked Dan, trying
to imitate the gruff tones of Mr. Austin, one
of the instructors who roomed in the building.
There was a howl of rage from the occupants of
the room and Dan turned and fled. The joke
kept him chuckling all the way around to Oxford,
where he posted Tom’s letter. Then he climbed
the stairs to his room in Clarke, threw open the
door and paused on the threshold in consternation.</p>

<p>In front of the washstand stood Gerald sopping
his face with a blood-stained towel. His nose was
swollen and bleeding, his knuckles were skinned
and he was crying.</p>

<p>“Why, Gerald! What’s the matter?” cried
Dan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>“N-nothing,” muttered Gerald, turning away.</p>

<p>“Nothing! Nothing be blowed! You’re a
sight!” He drew the towel away from the boy’s
face. “Why, you’ve been fighting! Who hit you
and how did it happen? Here, let me take the
towel. You sit down there and I’ll fix you up.
Who did it?”</p>

<p>“T-Thompson.”</p>

<p>“Who’s Thompson? And what did he hit you
for?”</p>

<p>“I hit him fu-first.”</p>

<p>“Well, what was it about? Let’s see your
hand. I should say you did hit him! You’ll need
some court plaster on those knuckles, my boy.
Does your nose hurt very much?”</p>

<p>“Yu-yes,” answered Gerald, struggling with
his sobs.</p>

<p>“Well, never mind; don’t cry any more; it’ll
feel better in a few minutes.”</p>

<p>“I’m not cr-crying because it hurts,” sobbed
Gerald, “I’m cr-crying because he li-licked me!”</p>

</div>


<p>Presently, when Gerald’s wounds were dressed,
Dan persuaded him to tell his story. He had
got over his tears and was looking rather depressed
and ashamed of himself.</p>

<p>“I was coming up the hill toward the gymnasium,”
began Gerald.</p>

<p>“What were you doing down there?” Dan
asked.</p>

<p>“I—I was just taking a walk along by the
river,” answered Gerald evasively.</p>

<p>Dan nodded. “Homesick,” he thought.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry you didn’t come back to the room,”
he said. “I waited here for you some time. I
wanted to take you over to see Loring and Dyer.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to go there,” answered Gerald.
“They don’t like me.”</p>

<p>“You’re mistaken. Tom asked me this afternoon
to bring you over often. They’re nice fellows
and I want you to like them. But never mind
about that now. What happened when you were
coming up from the river?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>“I met four or five fellows just this side of the
tennis courts, near the little red building, you
know.”</p>

<p>Dan nodded again.</p>

<p>“And one of them said something about ‘Miss
Nancy.’ I didn’t pay any attention and just kept
right on. Then this fellow Thompson—”</p>

<p>“Hold on! What sort of a looking fellow is
Thompson?”</p>

<p>“He—he’s kind of heavy, with dark hair, and
wears a plaid cap.”</p>

<p>“Sort of sallow, with a mole on his cheek? I
think I remember him. But he’s bigger than you,
isn’t he?”</p>

<p>“A little,” said Gerald grudgingly.</p>

<p>“All right. What happened?”</p>

<p>“He said ‘No, that’s Little Money-bags,’ and
the other fellows laughed, and one of them said
something I didn’t hear. Then Thompson said:
‘Oh, yes, his father’s got lots of money, but if
folks knew where he got it he’d be in prison.’”</p>

<p>“And then what?” asked Dan sympathetically.</p>

<p>“Nothing.”</p>

<p>“<em>Nothing?</em>”</p>

<p>“No, I—I just hit him!” Dan smiled.</p>

<p>“That wasn’t a very good thing to do, Gerald.
We don’t go in for that sort of thing here at
Yardley.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t care. What right had he to say that?
I did hit him and I’ll do it again if he talks that
way about my father!”</p>

<p>“Well, you hit him. Then, I suppose he hit
you?”</p>

<p>“No. He was going to, but some of the other
fellows ran in and said we’d be seen. Then
Thompson asked if I wanted to fight, and I said
I did, and we went back of the little red building
and—and—fought.”</p>

<p>“How long?”</p>

<p>“Just a minute. I couldn’t do anything, Dan.
He knew how to fight and I didn’t.”</p>

<p>“Well, but your knuckles—”</p>

<p>“I hit him once on the chin,” acknowledged
Gerald with satisfaction, “but that’s about all.
Then he hit me on the nose.”</p>

<p>“And that ended it?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I wanted to go on, but they wouldn’t let
me. One of them gave me a handkerchief—I
couldn’t find mine. It’s on the stand there.
Then I came up here.”</p>

<p>“Did anyone see you?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think so. I didn’t meet anyone but a
couple of fellows in front of Oxford. I don’t care
if they did see me.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s just as well that you didn’t run
across any of the Faculty,” said Dan dryly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
“Faculty doesn’t like scraps. How’s the nose
feeling?”</p>

<p>“All right now; it’s just sore. It—it felt as
though it was broken at first. Did you ever have
a real fight with another fellow, Dan?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ve had two or three scrimmages,” replied
Dan carelessly, “but not here. And I guess
you’d better make up your mind to let this be your
last one, Gerald.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to learn to box,” said Gerald determinedly.
“And when I know how I’m going
to lick Thompson.”</p>

<p>“Well,” answered Dan soothingly, “maybe you
won’t want to by that time.”</p>

<p>“Does it take long? Is it hard to learn?”</p>

<p>“Boxing? N-no, I guess not, but I don’t
know much about it: I never took any lessons.”</p>

<p>“Will you box with me sometimes in the gym?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” answered Dan, “but you’d better
get Alf Loring to show you; he’s a dandy at it,
they say.”</p>

<p>“Do you think he would?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but I’d forget about Thompson, Gerald.
I dare say he’s sorry for what he said. Did you
make up afterwards?”</p>

<p>Gerald shook his head.</p>

<p>“He wanted to shake hands, but I wouldn’t.
He’s got to apologize for what he said about my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
father, every word, before I’ll make up with him.”</p>

<p>“The best thing to do is to leave him alone and
forget all about it,” counseled Dan. “That’s
what I’d do.” Gerald shook his head.</p>

<p>“No, you wouldn’t,” he said sagely, and Dan
thought it best not to argue the matter.</p>

<p>“Shall you see Loring again soon?” asked
Gerald.</p>

<p>“I’ll see him to-morrow, I suppose. Why?”</p>

<p>“Will you ask him about boxing? Would you
mind?”</p>

<p>“No, but it would be much better if you asked
him yourself. We’ll drop around there this evening
for a few minutes.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Gerald, “but I’m afraid he’ll
think it’s awfully cheeky of me.”</p>

<p>“No, he won’t. Now let’s get fixed up for supper.
Let’s see how your nose looks. Well, I guess
most anyone would know that you’d been in some
sort of a mix-up, but it doesn’t look very bad.
You’d better look the other way, though, when
you meet any of the Faculty. How are the fellows
at your table, by the way?”</p>

<p>“All right, I guess. I don’t know any of them
very well, except a little chap named Merrow.”</p>

<p>“Merrow? Seems to me I know him. Oh, yes,
I met him coming up from the station the other
day. Is he nice?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, but he’s just a kid.” Presently Gerald
paused in his ablutions long enough to announce;
“I’m going to try for the Clarke hockey team,
Dan.”</p>

<p>“Are you? Did Bendix say you could play
hockey?”</p>

<p>“Yes, on the dormitory team. Hockey and
tennis. I don’t see why I can’t play baseball,
do you?”</p>

<p>“N-no, but I suppose Muscles has his reason.
How are you getting along at the gym?”</p>

<p>“All right. It’s mostly dumb-bells and wands
now, though. But it’s pretty good fun, isn’t it?
Next week we’re going to do stunts on the bars
and things like that. I think I’ve got more muscle
now than I had when I came, don’t you? Look.”
And Gerald pulled his sleeve up, exposing a
pathetically thin arm, and brought his clinched
hand up to his shoulder, watching Dan anxiously.</p>

<p>“Hm, yes, I believe you have,” said Dan
gravely. “You keep on, Gerald, and you’ll be
mightily surprised at the result. It’s wonderful
what you can do in the gym. I’ve only been here
about three months and I’ve increased my chest
expansion almost two inches.”</p>

<p>“Really? Mr. Bendix said I was awfully flat
chested, and I guess I am. I wish I had your
muscles, Dan.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>“You keep on and you will have. All ready?
Come on, then. Are you hungry?”</p>

<p>“Not very. I’m never very hungry, Dan.
Even at home I don’t eat much.”</p>

<p>“You wait until you’ve been here a little
longer,” laughed Dan, “and you won’t talk that
way!”</p>

<p>After supper they went over to Dudley.</p>

<p>“Here he is!” cried Alf as Dan opened the door
of Number 7. “What shall we do to him, Tom?
Hello, Pennimore, how are you?”</p>

<p>“Quite well, thank you,” replied Gerald politely.
Alf grinned at Dan.</p>

<p>“Glad you’re bringing him to be respectful,”
he whispered in Dan’s ear as Gerald spoke to
Tom. “Well, find seats, my worthy guests.
Hello, Pennimore! What’s happened to your
face? Sort of out of drawing, isn’t it? If I
didn’t know you for a peaceable citizen I’d say
you’d been—er—mixing it up a bit.”</p>

<p>Gerald looked diffidently at Dan.</p>

<p>“Tell your own story,” laughed Dan.</p>

<p>“I—I got hit,” muttered Gerald.</p>

<p>“Oh!” said Alf, suppressing a grin.</p>

<p>“Who hit you?” asked Tom.</p>

<p>“A fellow named Thompson. We—we had a
sort of a fight.”</p>

<p>“The dickens you did! What about?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>Then Gerald found courage to give an account
of the incident. Tom nodded approvingly.</p>

<p>“You did just right,” he said. “Sorry you
didn’t hurt him a bit worse. He’s a fresh kid,
anyway.”</p>

<p>“Still,” interposed Dan, with a meaning glance
at Tom, “I tell Gerald we don’t go in for scrapping
here.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” answered Tom. “We don’t—except
when it’s necessary. When a chap says
things about your parents, though, it’s necessary.
Just remember that, Pennimore. Don’t you take
any fellow’s dust. If he’s too big for you, just
you come and tell me; understand?”</p>

<p>“Yes, thank you,” replied Gerald. “I—I
didn’t want to fight, but there wasn’t anything
else I could do, was there?”</p>

<p>“Not a thing!” said Tom heartily. “Oh, you
may frown all you want to, Dan, but I’m right,
and you know it, you old hypocrite.”</p>

<p>“You’ll get Gerald into trouble if you give him
advice like that, though,” Dan objected. “Faculty
won’t stand for fights, and you know it.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but Collins won’t be hard on a fellow for
sticking up for the honor of the family, so to
speak. He’s human, Collins is. And I guess we
three know that as well as anyone. Ever fought
before, Gerald?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, I never have,” answered Gerald apologetically.
Alf laughed.</p>

<p>“Well, don’t apologize. After all, in spite of
Tom, we’re not all sluggers here.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to know something about fighting,
though,” said Gerald with a beseeching look at
Dan.</p>

<p>“He’s got a favor to ask of you, Alf, and he’s
afraid you’ll think he’s cheeky,” explained Dan.</p>

<p>“Of me? What is it? Let’s hear. I promise
now not to think you cheeky, Pennimore. Want
me to re-shape your nose for you?”</p>

<p>“I—I wondered whether you’d mind giving me
a few lessons in boxing,” said Gerald soberly.</p>

<p>“By Jove, I like your grit! Want to be ready
for the next one, eh?” Gerald didn’t reply.</p>

<p>“Fact is,” laughed Dan, “he wants to learn
how to fight so he can lick Thompson. I tell him
he’d better call it quits, but—”</p>

<p>“Oh, Alf will teach you, all right,” interrupted
Tom. “If he doesn’t I’ll make him.”</p>

<p>“You! You couldn’t make a cat sneeze!”
jeered Alf. “I’ll be very glad to show you what
I know, Pennimore,” he added kindly. “We’ll
get together some day real soon. We can use
the boxing room in the gym Saturday afternoons,
I guess. As to Thompson—well, you’ve shown
him you won’t stand for his nonsense, and I guess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
he will let you alone after this. But boxing is
mighty good exercise and it will do you good.”</p>

<p>“I’m awfully much obliged,” murmured Gerald.
“I guess you will find me pretty stupid,
though.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right. You’ll learn. You’re light
on your feet and you look quick. Here, don’t
rush off, Dan.”</p>

<p>“Must. Gerald and I have got studying to
do.”</p>

<p>“Well, so have I, but you don’t see me worrying
about it, do you?” laughed Alf. “Sit down
and be sociable.”</p>

<p>“Can’t, honest!” replied Dan. “Good night,
you fellows.”</p>

<p>After they had gone Tom looked across at Alf.</p>

<p>“Well?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Well what?”</p>

<p>“He isn’t such a sissy after all, is he?”</p>

<p>“Who? Little Geraldine?” asked Alf with a
laugh. “Oh, he will get on in time. Say, though,
doesn’t Dan remind you of old Mrs. Mother Hen
with her one chick?”</p>

<p>And Alf went off chuckling to find his books.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</a><br />
<small>A VISIT TO NEW YORK</small></h2>
</div>


<p>On the following Friday Dan and Gerald, suit-cases
in hand and ulsters on arm, climbed aboard
the express at a little before five o’clock and set
out for New York. It was a cloudy afternoon,
still and moderately cold. The river had been
frozen for several days, and as the train crossed
the bridge the boys could see the skaters moving
about through the twilight up near Loon Island.
They had their supper on the train—although
it was really dinner—and did their level
best to eat some of everything on the menu. In
this effort they were not quite successful, but they
managed to consume enough to interfere seriously
with their comfort. Luckily they had a
full hour—and it really was a full one—in which
to recover before the train rolled into the Grand
Central Station, by which time they were able to
take up their luggage and traverse the platform
without more than an occasional groan.</p>

<p>Mr. Pennimore had half promised to meet
them, but when Gerald had discovered the electric<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
brougham, the driver, a very smart looking youth
in trim livery, reported that Mr. Pennimore had
telephoned from downtown that he wouldn’t be
able to reach the station in time, but would meet
the boys at dinner.</p>

<p>“Dinner!” groaned Dan, casting a reproachful
look at Gerald. “Why didn’t you tell me we
were to have dinner after we got here?”</p>

<p>“I thought it would be lots more fun to eat on
the train,” replied Gerald. “You can eat at
home any time. Besides, we were hungry, Dan.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s so. But I’m not hungry now, and
I know I shan’t be able to even look at the table.”</p>

<p>They sped softly across town, only the low buzz
of the motor and the occasional jangle of the bell
penetrating to the interior of the carriage. Overhead
a light set behind ground glass cast a soft
glow over the rich upholstery. Dan looked and
marveled. At his feet an electric heater gave
warmth, in front of him a little silver clock ticked
away the minutes. The seat, upholstered in dark
blue leather, was as comfortable as a bed, and
Gerald was making the most of it. But Dan was
too excited to loll back in his corner. Instead, he
sat on the edge of the cushion and peered interestedly
out of the window. The brougham slowed
down and turned into Fifth Avenue, then buzzed
its way uptown past a steady stream of southward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
bound vehicles, automobiles, hansoms,
broughams, taxicabs, electrics, with now and then
a smart delivery wagon. Dan turned in bewilderment.</p>

<p>“Where’s every one going?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Theater, I suppose,” answered Gerald listlessly.
“It’s most eight o’clock.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Dan. He had never seen so many
carriages before in his life, nor so many lights,
nor so many persons. They were held up for a
moment at an intersecting street, and he watched
admiringly the majestic traffic policeman, and
wondered where every one <em>could</em> be going! Then
they went on again and the lights along the sidewalks
grew fewer. Shops gave way to residences,
and soon, through the window on Gerald’s side,
he saw the Park. He heaved a sigh.</p>

<p>“Gee, this is a big old place, Gerald,” he said
hopelessly.</p>

<p>“I hate it,” answered Gerald, arousing from
his drowsiness. “I have lots more fun at Sound
View than I do in New York. I wish father would
live at Sound View all the year. He says he’s
going to some day. Here we are, Dan.”</p>

<p>The brougham rolled slowly up to the curb and
stopped with a final peal of its bell. The door of
a white stone residence opened and a man in
livery came out and seized the bags and coats.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
Dan followed Gerald into the house, stepped
dazedly into a tiny room which turned out to be
an elevator, stepped out again and discovered Mr.
Pennimore awaiting them at the door of a big
library, evening paper in hand. After that
events followed each other so quickly that it was
all rather hazy to Dan. There was a moment’s
chat in front of a glowing fire, another excursion
in the elevator, a hurried preparation for dinner,
followed by a survey of Gerald’s bedroom and
sitting room which adjoined the apartment assigned
to Dan, a descent to the first floor, and—well,
then Dan found himself eating again just as
though he hadn’t already had one hearty dinner
that evening!</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, Gerald?” asked Mr. Pennimore
presently, interrupting himself anxiously.
“Has coming home spoiled your appetite?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, but we had our dinner on the train.”</p>

<p>“On the train! Well, well, that’s unfortunate!
Couldn’t wait, eh? But do the best you can, boys.
When I was your age I could always eat. Parker,
hand the vegetables to Mr. Vinton.”</p>

<p>When dinner was over it was much too late to
go anywhere, Mr. Pennimore decided. Gerald
was disappointed, but Dan was secretly glad
enough to sit down in a big, sleepy chair in front
of the library fire and just let the comfort and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
hominess of the place soak in. Mr. Pennimore
found lots of questions to ask, and it kept the
two boys busy answering them.</p>

<p>“You see, son,” said Mr. Pennimore, “your
letters are very interesting, but you’ve got an
exasperating way of paying no attention to the
questions I ask in mine. Have you been homesick,
Gerald?”</p>

<p>Gerald shot a glance at Dan, but that youth
was studying the flames as though he hadn’t
heard the question.</p>

<p>“Some, sir,” answered Gerald, “once or twice.”</p>

<p>“Getting over it now, though, I presume?
That’s right; just realize that Yardley’s to be
your home for the next few months and get
settled down. Have you made the acquaintance
of any more of the boys?”</p>

<p>“I—I don’t know any of them very well yet,
sir.”</p>

<p>“Of course not; all that takes time, I suspect.
You spoke of two of the boys in one of your letters.
What were their names?”</p>

<p>“Loring and Dyer,” answered Gerald.
“They’re—they’re Second Class fellows, and so
I don’t know them very well.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I gathered from what you wrote that you
did.” Gerald looked uneasily at Dan.</p>

<p>“Well, Loring’s going to give you boxing lessons,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
he said. “You know him well enough for
that. Gerald has an idea that fellows don’t care
about him unless they come right out and say so,”
Dan explained.</p>

<p>“Boxing lessons, you said?” inquired Mr. Pennimore.
“Isn’t boxing rather—er—strenuous
for a boy of your age?” He looked anxiously
from Dan to Gerald.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, sir,” answered Dan promptly. “It
isn’t hard at all. It’s one of the regular exercises
in the Second Class. Gerald just thought he’d
like to take it up now, and Alf Loring said he’d
show him how. It’s good exercise, sir.”</p>

<p>Gerald breathed easier. He had pledged Dan
to secrecy in regard to his trouble with Thompson,
and Dan’s unthinking reference to boxing had
brought his heart into his mouth.</p>

<p>“Well,” said his father doubtfully, “be careful.
Don’t try to learn everything the first year, son.”</p>

<p>The next forenoon was given over to sight-seeing.
Gerald acted as guide and showed Dan
as many of the points of interest as there was
time for, and Dan enjoyed himself hugely. They
had luncheon with Mr. Pennimore at his club.
Afterwards he handed them tickets for one of the
theaters and sent them off in a hansom.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry I can’t go with you,” he said, “but
I’ve got a great deal to do this afternoon. We’ll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
have dinner early and see a show together to-night.”</p>

<p>That was Dan’s first visit to a real theater, for
out in Graystone, Ohio, where he lived, the local
playhouse, known as the Academy of Music, was
little more than a fair-sized hall, and the attractions
which visited it seldom met with the approval
of Dan’s parents. To Gerald, on the
contrary, theaters and plays were an old story,
and he found half of his enjoyment in watching
Dan and in displaying his own knowledge and experience
of things theatrical. After the final curtain
had fallen Dan didn’t say anything until the
boys were out on the street. Then he drew a long
breath, sighed deeply, and exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Gee, that was great!”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t a bad show,” replied Gerald indifferently.</p>

<p>“Bad! It was simply elegant! I’ll bet if I
lived in New York I’d be at the theater every day!
I’d like to see that play again to-night!”</p>

<p>But instead he saw another one and voted it
even better, and would have kept Gerald up the
rest of the night talking about it if Gerald had
allowed it. Even as it was, it was long past mid-night
when they fell asleep. The next forenoon
they went to church with Mr. Pennimore. The
church was a new source of wonderment to Dan.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
He had never imagined that a church could be so
beautiful as was that one, and if he missed a great
deal of the service, it was only because his eyes
and thoughts were busy with the great altar, the
wonderful stained glass windows, and all the
architectural marvels and color before him.</p>

<p>Dinner was at two o’clock on Sunday, a long-drawn-out
repast of many courses. It wasn’t altogether
a success to-day, for every one was rather
silent. The impending return to school brought
no joy to the boys, while Mr. Pennimore was saddened
by the thought of having to part with Gerald
for several months. At a little before four
the electric brougham rolled up to the curb in
front of the house, and good-byes were said. Mr.
Pennimore was to sail early Tuesday morning.
Gerald begged to be allowed to remain in town
and see him off, but his father wouldn’t allow it.</p>

<p>“No, no,” he said smilingly, “that wouldn’t
do, son. Why, I might lose my courage at the
last moment and take you with me!”</p>

<p>“I wish you would,” said Gerald dismally,
clinging tightly to his father’s hand.</p>

<p>“What? And take you away from school?
Oh, that wouldn’t do at all. No, we’ll say good-bye
now, Gerald. You write me regularly and
send your first letter to the address I gave you,
so that I’ll find it when I get to London. Good-bye,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
Dan. Take good care of yourself. We
three are going to have some good times this summer,
and I want you well and strong. And keep
an eye on this boy here; don’t let him get into too
much mischief. And write me a letter yourself
some day and put it in with Gerald’s. Now,
you’ll have to hurry if you’re going to catch that
train. Good-bye, Gerald. Be a good boy, and
don’t forget to write to me. Remember me to the
Doctor when you see him. Good-bye, good-bye!”</p>

<p>Then they were rolling away to the station,
Gerald rather tearful, and Dan feeling a little bit
blue himself, without being able to find a good
reason for it. But by the time New Haven was
reached the spirits of each had risen considerably,
and they were able to take some interest in the
things which the waiter placed before them in the
dining car. Neither had eaten much dinner in
New York, and so they found that they had very
fair appetites. It’s wonderful what food will do
in the way of cheering one up! When they tossed
their bags into the carriage at Wissining and
climbed in after them they were as merry as you
please. A sprinkle of snow had fallen while they
had been on the train, and there was a jolly feeling
of winter in the air. Ahead of them, on the
hill, the windows of the school buildings twinkled
a welcome to them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>“Getting back isn’t so bad, after all, is it?”
asked Dan. And Gerald agreed that it wasn’t.</p>

<p>They hurried to the Office to register their return,
and then scampered up the stairs of Clarke.
And when Dan had lighted the drop-light on the
study table and the familiar objects in the room
met their gaze, why, it was quite like getting
home!</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</a><br />
<small>THE SNOW BATTLE</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The snow held off that winter until the last
week in January. Then, as though to make up
for its neglect, it came down steadily for three
days together and covered the Prospect and the
Yard two feet deep. Of course, I don’t mean that
the snow confined its attentions to the vicinity
of the school; the world was white as far as one
could see, save on the Sound; and there were days
when you couldn’t catch a glimpse of that for
the scurrying flakes. But it was around the
school that the fellows were best able to judge
of its depth. Of course, Mr. McCarthy, the janitor,
whose real name was Owen, and not McCarthy
at all, fought valiantly with his helpers to
keep the paths clear, but just as fast as they
shoveled snow away, more fell. There was little
wind, and so there were no drifts, a lucky circumstance
for Mr. McCarthy. Skating for the time
was spoiled, and just when the hockey clubs were
finding their ice-legs, to coin an expression. But
snow-battles took the place of ice sports, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
there were some fine contests in the Yard. The
principal battle of that campaign was one which
took place at half-past four one afternoon, and
lasted until darkness imposed a truce. It started
out in a very small way.</p>

<p>Gerald was crossing from the gymnasium to
Clarke. Over in front of Dudley a handful of
older boys were good-naturedly pelting each other
with snowballs. Back of Whitson, Thompson,
the youth with whom Gerald had tried conclusions
a fortnight ago, was vainly trying to throw a
snowball in at the window of one of the third-floor
rooms, where a friend of his laughed defiance
from behind the curtain. Gerald had
reached the sun-dial in the center of the Yard
before Thompson spied him. Then:</p>

<p>“Oh, see who’s here,” shouted Thompson gleefully
to his friend. “Watch me soak him, Joe.”</p>

<p>The first missile passed harmlessly by Gerald’s
head, but the second was better aimed, and lodged
uncomfortably against Gerald’s neck. Gerald
brushed it away and tramped on. He recognized
his enemy, but so far he had had but one lesson
from Alf, and wasn’t yet ready for Mr. Thompson.
Unfortunately, every step toward Clarke
brought him nearer Thompson, and as Thompson
was a rather good shot, progress became instantly
more difficult. He thought of dropping the bundle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
of books which he carried and retaliating, but he
knew himself for a poor shot, and was sure that
such an engagement would end in undignified rout
on his part. So he shielded his face as best he
could and went on. It’s no joke to get a well-made
snowball, thrown from a distance of sixty
feet, against your head, and that’s what happened
to Gerald more than once after he had passed the
corner of Dudley. He wanted to run, but was too
proud. Encouraged by the laughing applause of
his friend at the window above, Thompson advanced
to meet his prey, a particularly well-moulded
snowball ready to throw.</p>

<p>But he didn’t throw it. For at that moment
his cap went off, his ear was filled with snow, and
he staggered aside from the shock and unexpectedness
of the attack. It was a long shot, and a
lucky one, and I doubt if the small boy standing
on the back porch of Merle could have duplicated
it in twenty tries. But it accomplished its purpose,
for it allowed Gerald to reach the safety of
Clarke Hall. Thompson swung around with a
laugh of annoyance, and spied his new adversary.</p>

<p>“Hello, kid!” he shouted. “Want yours, do
you? Well, you stay there and you’ll get it.”</p>

<p>Harry Merrow stayed, not because he wanted
to very much, but because, like Gerald, he was too
proud to run. It was an unequal conflict, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
Thompson, advancing steadily along the walk,
scored three hits to the younger boy’s one. The
group in front of Dudley had paused and were
watching the fray, applauding Merrow loudly.</p>

<p>“Give it to him, kid! You’re all right! Now’s
your chance! Take your time!”</p>

<p>But the battle would have ended disastrously
for Merrow had not another Merle Hall boy, attracted
by the shouts, put his head out of an upstairs
window and seen what was going on. Now,
there’s a fine spirit of <em>camaraderie</em> among the
Preparatory Class. For one thing, the boys of
that class all room together in Merle, and get to
know each other thoroughly. And in the present
case <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">esprit de corps</i> came to the rescue of Merrow.
The boy at the window disappeared quickly,
and a minute later the back of Merle was black
with boys.</p>

<p>“Merle, this way! Merle, this way!” was the
cry.</p>

<p>Thompson held out for a moment, and then, the
target for dozens of snowballs, retreated toward
Whitson. But the fellows in front of Dudley
could remain neutral no longer.</p>

<p>“Rush the kids!” was the cry, and the battle
was on. Five minutes later almost every fellow
in school was ranged on one side of the Yard or
the other. The new arrivals neither knew nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
cared about the merits of the controversy. They
simply joined whichever army was nearest. Alf
and Tom and Dan, gathered in Number 7 Dudley,
soon heard the noise of battle and joined the fray,
Tom in his shirt-sleeves.</p>

<p>“What’s it all about?” asked Alf of another
boy.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Merle started it, they say.
They’ve been fighting like little fiends, the kids
have. Look out! Just missed you! Let’s rush
’em again!”</p>

<p>There were plenty of rushes in which the opposing
sides, or the more valorous of them, met
in the middle of the field of battle and fought at
close quarters. Out there there was little time
to make snowballs. One must simply scoop up
snow and hurl it at his adversary, grapple with
him, perhaps, and roll him over and “wash his
face,” or stuff snow down his back and into his
ears and mouth. It was hand-to-hand out there,
and many brave deeds were done and many gallant
rescues performed. One ate snow and
breathed it and was blinded by it, and wallowed
in it, and picked himself out of it gasping and
shouting. Then, as though by mutual understanding,
the opposing armies drew apart, still
hurling snow and shouting defiance, to view their
casualties and draw breath for a renewed attack.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>Gerald, drawn from his room by the shouting
and laughter, looked on for a minute, and then
dodged around the Yard and joined the forces in
front of Merle. The next moment he was rolling
snowballs and firing with the best of them, the
ardor of battle taking possession of him.</p>

<p>“Hello, Pennimore!” cried a voice at his ear.
“Isn’t it fun? They tried to rush us three times,
and we beat them back!”</p>

<p>It was Harry Merrow, his cap off, his sweater
crusted with snow, his cheeks flaming, and his
eyes afire with excitement. Dan, had he been at
hand to see, would have had difficulty in recognizing
in the person of this young warrior the
tearful, homesick lad he had met in the carriage.</p>

<p>“That was a dandy shot of yours,” said Gerald
gratefully. “Did he hurt you?”</p>

<p>“Who? Thompson? I guess not! I’m not
afraid of him! There they go! Come on!”</p>

<p>And Gerald was caught, willy nilly, in the forward
surge of the little army and swept out into
the field. Then snowballs were flying thick and
fast, boys went down left and right, assailant and
assailed rolling over on the trampled field of
battle. Twilight was coming fast, and already it
was difficult to tell friend from enemy. Gerald
had lost sight of Harry Merrow, and, for that
matter, scarcely knew whether he was attacking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
his comrades or his opponents. But he scooped
up snow and dashed it wherever he saw a face,
dodged in and out of the mêlée, and was having a
lovely time, when something happened. His heels
went into the air, his head bumped into the snow,
and then, struggle as he might, he was being
dragged feet-foremost toward the enemy’s line.
He disputed every inch of the way, his hands
groping blindly for something to hold to, and his
face plowing up the snow. And then, just when
he was certain he would suffocate the next moment,
he was released and rolled over.</p>

<p>“You’re captured, kid,” laughed a familiar
voice. “Will you fight on our side?”</p>

<p>Gerald, sputtering and choking, looked up into
the face of Dan.</p>

<p>“No, I’m on the other side,” he gasped heroically.</p>

<p>“Why, it’s Gerald!” cried Dan. He pulled
him to his feet. “Did I hurt you?”</p>

<p>“Not a bit,” said Gerald, rubbing his wet face
against a wetter sleeve. Hurt! Of course he
wasn’t hurt; he never felt finer in his life! What
if his nose did seem to have been scraped to the
bone? It was all glorious!</p>

<p>“Well, you’re prisoner,” laughed Dan. “If
you won’t fight with us you must give your parole.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>“What’s that?” asked Gerald, as Dan, a hand
on his arm, led him back toward Dudley.</p>

<p>“Why, agree not to fight again,” Dan explained.
“You stay over there on the steps.”</p>

<p>“But I want to fight!” cried Gerald.</p>

<p>“All right, then, fight. Hello, Alf! Did you
get any?”</p>

<p>“Yes, we got nine altogether.”</p>

<p>“Where are they?”</p>

<p>“Oh, here somewhere. They’re going to fight
with us.”</p>

<p>“Is it right to do that?” asked Gerald anxiously.</p>

<p>“Of course! That’s the way we play the game
here.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll fight,” said Gerald.</p>

<p>“Hello!” cried Alf, coming up, “where’d you
get Gerald?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I fished him out of the bunch,” laughed
Dan. “I didn’t know who he was until I’d
dragged him half-way across the Yard. He’s going
to join our side.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” said Alf. “We’ll get a lot
more next time. They got Tom, though.”</p>

<p>“Not really! Think of old Tom getting caught!
Let’s rush ’em again before it gets too dark.”</p>

<p>Then Alf and Dan and Gerald and almost a
hundred others dashed forward again with a yell,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
and from the other side of the Yard the enemy
came to meet them, and it was all a grand turmoil
in the half darkness. Both sides were out for
prisoners now, and there was less throwing of
snow and more good, hard tussles. So far as
Gerald could see, no one lost his temper, or, if he
did, he found it again the next moment.</p>

<p>“You’d better keep back,” panted Alf, “or
some one will grab you, Gerald.”</p>

<p>But Gerald didn’t care about that. In fact, he
rather wanted to be grabbed. He wanted to
match his strength against some one, friend or
foe. And so he rushed into the thick of battle,
fell, picked himself up, was caught around the
waist and wriggled free, seized a boy almost twice
his size in a vain endeavor to make a prisoner of
him, and found himself with his face in the snow
and the battle raging fiercely above him. He
crawled out of there quickly, for it wasn’t pleasant
to be walked on, staggered to his feet and drew
breath. The Merle side was giving ground. Behind
him at least a dozen prisoners were being
hurried away. But the combat still raged, and
the shouting continued. Suddenly, out from the
enemy’s ranks darted a form and grappled with
a boy who, standing almost at Gerald’s side, had,
like himself, paused to take breath. Down they
went together, there was a moment’s tussle, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
then the enemy, having cunningly seized his victim’s
feet, started back with him. Both sides
were now drawing off, and for an instant Gerald
hesitated. Then, with a shrill cry of challenge,
he darted forward and threw himself against the
captor. The next moment Gerald and the boy he
had rescued were running back toward Dudley.
The captor, surprised by the unexpected attack,
didn’t think of pursuit until too late.</p>

<p>“Much obliged,” panted the rescued youth, as
he and Gerald reached safety.</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” said Gerald carelessly. But
secretly he was immensely proud of his exploit.
At that moment they stepped into the circle of
light thrown by the lantern over the door of
Dudley.</p>

<p>“Hello!” cried the other. “If it isn’t Pennimore!
What do you think of that? Why, you
and I started this scrap!”</p>

<p>It was Thompson. Gerald viewed him doubtfully.</p>

<p>“You mean you did,” he answered rather
stiffly. Thompson laughed and clapped him on
the back.</p>

<p>“That’s so, I guess I did. Well, say, Pennimore,
I’m sorry I snowballed you. But we’re
quits now, aren’t we?”</p>

<p>And with another laugh and a nod Thompson<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
turned away, leaving Gerald at a loss and a little
indignant. What’s the good, he asked himself,
of having a grudge against a fellow who makes
apologies to you and claps you on the back? It
was perfectly absurd! He looked aggrievedly in
the direction taken by Thompson, and frowned.
Then, thrusting his wet, aching hands into his
trousers pockets, he turned and walked moodily
toward Clarke. At the corner of the dormitory
he looked back. Plainly, the combat was over.
A few desultory snowballs arched across the Yard,
and an occasional taunting cry or shout of defiance
followed. But the two armies were dwindling
away fast. It was quite dark now, and the
battleground was illumined only by the streams of
warm, yellow light which came from the dormitory
windows. Gerald climbed to his room, feeling as
though the zest had been suddenly taken out
of life. Dan found him there a few minutes
later, when, wet and glowing, he threw open the
door.</p>

<p>“Why, what’s the matter with you, Gerald?”
he asked in surprise. “You look as though you
were waiting to watch your funeral go by!” He
walked over and laid his hand on the younger
boy’s shoulder. “Look here,” he said anxiously,
“I didn’t hurt you, did I?”</p>

<p>“No,” answered Gerald dully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then what’s—”</p>

<p>“It’s Thompson,” burst out Gerald.</p>

<p>“Thompson? Again? What’s he done now?”
And Dan’s gaze examined Gerald’s face anxiously
for evidences of recent encounters.</p>

<p>“He hasn’t done anything,” muttered Gerald.</p>

<p>“Then what—”</p>

<p>So Gerald told his trouble, and Dan laughed
until it hurt. And after a while Gerald managed
to smile, too.</p>

<p>“But I don’t see how that makes us quits, Dan,”
he said seriously. “He snowballed me all across
the Yard, and then I ran in and rescued him from
some big chap who was making him prisoner. I
don’t see that he’s done anything to make it
quits, do you?”</p>

<p>“No, I can’t say I do,” laughed Dan. “But
it’s funny, just the same, the cheek of it. Thompson
must have a keen sense of humor, Gerald.”</p>

<p>“He had no business to hit me on the back and
say we were quits,” said Gerald stubbornly.</p>

<p>“Well, he did it; apologized, too. You can’t
fight a chap for that, Gerald, I guess.”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t suppose so.” Gerald was silent
a moment. Then: “But I’m going to keep
on learning to box, Dan, just the same,” he declared.</p>

<p>“Well, there’s no harm in that,” replied Dan,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
getting out of his wet clothes. “It’s a good thing
to know, boxing.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Gerald hopefully, “because maybe
he will do something else some day, and then I’ll
be ready for him!”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII</a><br />
<small>GERALD REVOLTS</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Gerald wasn’t getting on very well with his
studies. With English and Latin he was having
little trouble, but French was a stumbling block,
while as to mathematics—well, Gerald and algebra
weren’t friends. And the worst of it was
that Kilts, as Mr. McIntyre was called by the students,
had got it into his head that Gerald wasn’t
really trying to get along. This, at first, wasn’t
true. But by the middle of February it must be
acknowledged that Gerald had taken such a dislike
to algebra, and Kilts, too, for that matter,
that the latter had good reason for his suspicion.
Kilts was a severe disciplinarian, and had small
sympathy for boys who were not willing to work.
He could forgive dullness, was often patience itself
with a student who tried to learn and couldn’t,
but he could make life very unpleasant for any
member of his classes who didn’t try. And by
the middle of February affairs were at an acute
stage between Kilts and Gerald.</p>

<p>“Tell me, Mr. Pennimore,” he asked one morning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
with his best sarcasm, “is there any subject
I could substitute for algebra that would interest
you?” As Gerald made no reply—having learned
by this time the wisdom of declining McIntyre’s
challenges to debate—but merely sat with red
cheeks, listening to the suppressed giggles of the
fellows around him, Kilts construed the boy’s
silence to please himself.</p>

<p>“Ah, there is, then! Now, tell me what it is,
sir, and I’ll bring the matter up in Faculty Meeting,
and perhaps we can make the change. Would
it be embroidery—or jack-straws—or puss-in-the-corner?
Would it be any of those, Mr. Pennimore?”</p>

<p>Gerald sat silent with burning cheeks.</p>

<p>“Come, come, Mr. Pennimore! Let us hear it,
pray. Don’t be afraid to speak up. What would
it be, now?”</p>

<p>“Manners!” blurted Gerald, trembling with
anger. Mr. McIntyre’s little Scotch eyes blazed
and the class sobered instantly. But the instructor’s
voice was surprisingly gentle as he replied:</p>

<p>“Ah, an excellent choice, sir, an excellent choice.
I ken ye know your own requirements, and I’ll see
what we can do for ye. (Mr. McIntyre was liable
to fall back into Scotch brogue on occasions, occasions
which the boys who knew him well were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
prone to dread.) Ay, ay, manners are what ye
need, doubtless.”</p>

<p>Mr. McIntyre smiled gently and took up his
book again. Some one ventured to laugh nervously,
but the look which he received killed his
mirth instantly. Proceedings were resumed, and
for the rest of the half-hour Kilts took no notice
of Gerald. When class was over Gerald hurried
out of the room and over to Clarke with blazing
eyes, half beside himself with anger. Dan happened
to be in the room, and to him Gerald poured
forth his tale. But if he expected sympathy or
indignation, he was doomed to disappointment.
Dan heard the story calmly.</p>

<p>“Well, I guess it’s you for the Office, Gerald,”
he said with a frown. “What made you be such
an ass as to say that to Kilts? Don’t you know
he’s got a temper like a ginger-jar?”</p>

<p>Gerald stared in amazement.</p>

<p>“But—but see what he said to me!” he gasped.
“Do you think I’m going to sit quiet and take that,
Dan? I guess not! What right had he to insult
me before the whole class? He—he’s nothing but
a Scotch beggar, anyway!”</p>

<p>“He’s one of the best mathematicians in the
country,” replied Dan quietly, “and no matter
what else he is, he’s your teacher and you ought
to treat him politely. If he was impolite to you,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
that’s no reason for you to answer back, Gerald.”</p>

<p>“Well, I did it!” cried Gerald hotly. “And
I’ll do it again if he ever says things like that to
me.”</p>

<p>“Maybe you won’t have a chance,” replied Dan
dryly. “You’d better wait until you’ve seen Collins.
You’ve got yourself into a nasty hole,
Gerald, and you might as well realize it. Fellows
have been suspended here for less than what
you’ve done.”</p>

<p>“Let them suspend me, then,” said Gerald
hotly. “I don’t care what they do! I’m sick and
tired of this place, anyway. Every one’s down
on me, the teachers and every one else! And you
don’t care, either. You’re just like Loring and
Dyer and those fellows. I hope they send me
home! I’d rather be there than here!”</p>

<p>“And how about your father?” asked Dan
gently. “Think he’d be pleased, Gerald? Now,
look here!” Dan laid a hand kindly on the boy’s
shoulder. “Don’t make any more of a mess of it,
Gerald. You were wrong in answering back, and
you must see that. Why, it’s sort of as though
you were in the army, Gerald. Kilts is your superior
officer, you see, and it’s your place to take
what he says and keep your mouth closed. And
you know as well as I do that you haven’t been
pegging at algebra lately the way you ought to.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
You’ve got it into your head that you can’t do it,
and now you don’t try. And Kilts sees that and
doesn’t like it. He’s got a sharp tongue, has
Kilts, and I dare say he said things he shouldn’t
have said, but that’s not for you to bother about.
What you want to do is to knuckle down and see
that he doesn’t have a chance to get after you
again. I’ll say one thing for Kilts, and that is,
if he sees a fellow is trying to get along he will
help him all he can. I’ve seen that myself, lots
of times.”</p>

<p>“He’s a brute,” muttered Gerald rebelliously.</p>

<p>“No, he really isn’t. He’s awfully human, and
he’s got a temper. Look at the way he acted last
Fall when Jones painted up the front of Dudley
that time! When Toby came along Kilts was out
there with soap and water trying to wash out the
paint so the fellow who did it wouldn’t get into
trouble. He’s hard to get along with, but he’s
pretty fair in the long run. Now, you listen to
what Collins has to say, and tell him you were
angry and excited and didn’t mean to insult Kilts.
Then you take your medicine and buckle down and
make up your mind to show Kilts that you are
just as smart as any other fellow in your class.
Maybe Collins will let you down easily this time.
But you don’t want to talk to him the way you’ve
talked to me, Gerald. That won’t do at all.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
Let him understand that you’re sorry and—”</p>

<p>“I’m not sorry,” declared Gerald. “I’m
glad.”</p>

<p>“Well, you’ll get over it, then,” said Dan, a
trifle impatiently. “Don’t try to ride the high-horse
with Collins, or you’ll be down and out in
no time. I know you have had a rather tough
time of it in some ways since you came, but now,
just when things are getting better, don’t go and
spoil it all. Why, you made the hockey team last
week, and you’ve met a lot of fellows who will be
nice to you if you’ll let them. Don’t spoil it all
now and disappoint your father, Gerald.”</p>

<p>Gerald made no answer, and after waiting a
moment, Dan took up his books and moved toward
the door.</p>

<p>“Well, I must be off,” he said. “See you after
dinner, Gerald.”</p>

<p>Gerald nodded sullenly.</p>

<p>But after dinner Gerald was not to be found,
and the two didn’t meet again until just before
supper. Dan had been skating on the river, and
was feeling fine until he entered Number 28 and
caught sight of Gerald’s glum face bending over a
book.</p>

<p>“Hello,” he said, peeling off his sweater,
“where were you at noon?”</p>

<p>“Office,” answered Gerald shortly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>“Who did you see? Collins? What did he
say?” asked Dan anxiously.</p>

<p>“Oh, he said a lot,” replied Gerald disgustedly.
“Lectured me for half an hour, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Well? It’s all right, eh? He didn’t punish
you?”</p>

<p>“Didn’t he?” asked Gerald bitterly. “He says
I’ve got to stay in bounds for two weeks, and I
can’t play on the hockey team.” Dan gave a sigh
of relief.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s good. I was afraid he’d suspend
you. But Collins is a pretty good sort. You got
off easy, all right.”</p>

<p>“Easy! I’m glad you think so. I suppose it
doesn’t make much difference to you, though,”
said Gerald bitterly. “You’ll have your fun just
the same, you and Loring and Dyer! No one
cares how badly I get—get stung!”</p>

<p>“That’s nonsense,” said Dan. “Of course I’m
sorry he put you on probation but it might have
been lots worse, Gerald. I was afraid he’d send
you home for a couple of weeks, and that would
have been the dickens!”</p>

<p>“I wish he had sent me home!”</p>

<p>“Don’t be silly,” begged Dan. “Two weeks on
probation isn’t much. It’ll be gone before you
know it. And there’ll be plenty of hockey left
for you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, it’s easy enough for you to talk! You
haven’t lost your place on the team!”</p>

<p>“Yes, I suppose that does queer you there,”
mused Dan. “Still, you’ve got three years yet,
Gerald, and what does it matter if you don’t
make a dormitory team this year? Just you
practice all you can and then, maybe, next year
you can get on the Varsity. And that’s more
than I’ve been able to do!”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to wait until next year,” answered
Gerald irritably. “I want to play now.
And I don’t think it’s fair to say I can’t play just
because Kilts insulted me, and I answered back.
And what’s more, I won’t stand it!”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid you’ll have to,” replied Dan impatiently.
“It’s no use going to Toby; he always
stands by Collins.”</p>

<p>“I don’t intend to go to Toby,” replied Gerald.</p>

<p>“That’s right,” said Dan cheerfully. “Buck
up and take your medicine. Have you written
your father to-day?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“You’re going to, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” muttered Gerald.</p>

<p>“You’d better. You tell him just how it all
happened, and I’ll write a note, too, and you can
put it in your letter. You see, Collins is sure to
write to him and report the matter, and he will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
think it’s much worse than it is if you don’t explain.
Now, come on and let’s eat.”</p>

<p>At dinner Dan promised Alf to go over to the
latter’s room later in the evening.</p>

<p>“I guess I’ll bring Gerald along, if you don’t
mind,” he said. “He’s feeling rather down in the
mouth.”</p>

<p>“Of course, bring him along,” answered Alf.</p>

<p>But when the time came Gerald refused to go.</p>

<p>“I don’t care to go where I’m not wanted,” he
declared, and all of Dan’s persuasion failed to
move him. In the end Dan went alone, feeling
rather guilty at leaving Gerald there in the dumps.</p>

<p>Events proved that Dan would have done better
to have remained at home that evening, for Gerald
was in a bitter mood. He really believed that he
had been treated unjustly by the Faculty in the
persons of Mr. McIntyre and Mr. Collins, and
was jealous of Alf and Tom. It seemed to him
to-night that nothing but trouble had fallen to his
lot since his advent at Yardley. The fellows had
shown that he wasn’t wanted, he had been insulted
by Thompson and Mr. McIntyre, and, worst blow
of all, Dan was tired of him and spent more of his
time at Number 7 Dudley than he did in his own
room. Gerald gloomed for a while, and then took
paper and pen and tried to write his mid-week
letter to his father in England. But the sentences<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
wouldn’t shape themselves, and he soon gave up
the effort. He tried to study, but could make
nothing of that, either. So he started to think
things over again, and the more he thought the
worse everything appeared to him, until, at last,
with an exclamation of defiance, he strode to his
closet and pulled down his suit-case from the
shelf. For the next ten minutes he was busy
packing such of his things as he could take from
his chiffonier without endangering his secret.
His brushes and comb, and things of that sort, he
would have to leave until morning, but it wouldn’t
take a moment to drop them in. His preparations
completed, he put the bag back on the shelf and
got ready for bed, cheerful and excited. When
Dan returned, just before ten, Gerald was in bed,
and apparently fast asleep.</p>

<small>GERALD LEAVES SCHOOL</small></h2>
</div>


<p>In the morning Dan was glad to find that
Gerald had evidently quite recovered and was
himself again.</p>

<p>“Alf and Tom were sorry you didn’t go over
last night,” said Dan. “Alf says you’re not to
forget your boxing lesson Saturday. He says
with about two more lessons he will fix you so you
can go and knock spots out of Kilts.”</p>

<p>Gerald smiled.</p>

<p>“I won’t forget,” he said. “Maybe, though,
I’ll give up boxing. I don’t believe there’s going
to be—be any necessity for knowing how.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m glad you’ve decided to call it off
with Thompson,” said Dan. “I guess he means
to behave himself now.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to call it off with other folks, too,”
remarked Gerald; with which cryptic utterance
he went off to breakfast.</p>

<p>Dan looked puzzled.</p>

<p>“Now, what did he mean by that?” he asked,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
half aloud. “I wonder if he has some new foolishness
in his mind.”</p>

<p>To-day, as it happened, Dan’s recitations kept
him away from the room all the morning, except
for a half-hour between eleven and eleven-thirty,
at which time, as he knew, Gerald had Latin with
Mr. Collins, and so it was not until after twelve
o’clock that the first suspicion reached him. Then,
in front of Oxford, he ran across Joe Chambers.
Joe was one of the sub-editors of the school
weekly, <cite>The Scholiast</cite>, a Third Class fellow
who wore glasses, looked cultured to the best of
his ability, and was always on the watch for news
for his paper. He buttonholed Dan at once.</p>

<p>“Say, Vinton, what’s up with Pennimore?”</p>

<p>“Nothing that will make ‘copy’ for you, Chambers.
He got into trouble in class yesterday, and
Faculty put him on probation. How did you hear
of it?”</p>

<p>Chambers looked puzzled.</p>

<p>“I didn’t hear of it at all,” he replied. “I
didn’t mean that. But I met him this morning
with a big bag, and asked him where he was going,
and he said ‘Home.’ I thought maybe there was
something up, you know; somebody sick or something
of that sort. Is there?”</p>

<p>For a moment Dan didn’t answer. He was
thinking hard. Then:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, there’s nothing wrong at home. What he
meant was that he was going down to Sound View.
He took a lot of things over there to get them out
of the way. The closets in Clarke are so tiny that
there isn’t room for much of anything. Well, I
must be getting on. Of course, you needn’t say
anything about Gerald’s being on probation.
He’s sort of thin-skinned, you know.”</p>

<p>“I won’t mention it,” answered Chambers
earnestly. “Much obliged.” Dan nodded and
Chambers hurried away.</p>

<p>For a moment Dan stood there at a loss. He
had not the least doubt that Gerald had left school.
He recalled his manner before breakfast, that
mysterious remark of his. But he could easily
make certain. He hurried across to Clarke and
raced up the stairs. The top of Gerald’s chiffonier
was clear of toilet articles, many of his shirts
and undergarments were missing from the
drawers, his suit-case was gone from the closet
shelf. Dan looked at his watch, went to his top
drawer and took out a little japanned tin box
which he unlocked with a key on his watch chain.
From the box he took a little roll of money.
Placing this carefully in a vest pocket, he made
his way downstairs again. Once outside he
walked slowly and loiteringly to The Prospect and
turned into the path leading across the railroad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
track and through the woods. But once out of
sight of the school he broke into a trot. Where
the wood paths diverged he kept to the right, and
was soon hurrying along beside a high rustic fence
which marked the boundary of the Pennimore
estate. Presently he reached a spot where a
number of the palings had been torn away. In the
Fall Gerald and he had used this route to and
from the school as it was much shorter than the
way which led around by the roads. Dan squirmed
through the hole and sped across the turf. Presently
he was on the drive and the big stone residence
was in front of him. The curtains were
down at all the windows and the place looked
utterly deserted, but he crossed the terrace and
rang the bell beside the wide door. After a while
the door opened and a wrinkled caretaker put her
head out.</p>

<p>“I’m looking for Gerald,” Dan explained. “I
thought maybe he was here: Is he?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, he ain’t here. I ain’t seen him since
last week.”</p>

<p>“You—you’re sure?” asked Dan anxiously.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. He couldn’t get in without my knowing
it, sir. There ain’t nothin’ happened to him,
sir, has there?”</p>

<p>“No, no, but I couldn’t find him, and one of the
fellows said he’d seen him coming this way. I’m<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
much obliged.” And Dan turned toward the
main drive which led to the Lodge and the gates,
and so to the village road. At the Lodge he
asked again, but the gardener’s wife declared that
Gerald hadn’t entered the gates that day.</p>

<p>“Well, if you should see him, I wish you’d tell
him that I want to see him on a very important
matter. I’m his roommate at school, you know.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, very well, sir, I’ll be sure and tell
him.”</p>

<p>Dan hurried through the gates and along the
road which leads to the station. He had not expected
to find Gerald at Sound View, and so was
not disappointed. He looked at his watch and
increased his pace. Some distance away the noon
express whistled for the station. Dan reached
the train just as the conductor raised his hand in
signal to the engineer. He sank into a seat in one
of the day coaches and got his breath back. When
the conductor came through Dan paid his fare,
and asked when the train was due in New York.</p>

<p>“Three-thirty,” was the reply.</p>

<p>It would be quick work, thought Dan. He must
get to Gerald’s house, persuade Gerald to return,
and then reach the station in time for the five
o’clock train back to Wissining. That would
bring them to the school at about a quarter before
eight and if all went well there was no reason why<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
any one should suspect their absence. But to take
a later train would be to court disaster, since they
would reach the school long after ten o’clock, and
would be almost certain to be discovered. An
hour and a half was mighty little time, Dan
thought anxiously, in which to reach the Pennimore
house, show Gerald the error of his ways,
and return to the station. But he believed he
could do it. If only the train was on time! Dan
pulled out the rest of his money and counted it
over. There wasn’t a great deal of it, but it ought
to do. He was good and hungry by now, and the
waiter’s announcement of “Dinner now ready in
the dining car!” found at least one sympathetic
listener. But dinner in the dining car meant parting
from a whole dollar, and Dan’s finances
wouldn’t stand that. At New Haven, however,
he jumped out and bought a cup of coffee, a sandwich
and three bananas. He managed to get
through with the coffee and sandwich while the
train waited, but the bananas were taken on board
and lasted for several miles. After that he felt
more cheerful and looked forward quite optimistically
to his task ahead. He squandered another
ten cents on a magazine and managed to pass the
rest of the journey without difficulty. The train
rolled into the big station just on time, and Dan
was off it and racing up the platform before it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
had come to a stop. There was no time to lose.</p>

<p>His plans were all made, and it only remained
to carry them out. During his visit to the city
with Gerald he had made the acquaintance of
taxicabs, and now he climbed into one with a
nonchalant air, and gave the driver the address.
But, although he lolled back in the seat as though
taxicabs were an everyday occurrence with him,
he kept an anxious eye on the meter as they sped
uptown. It was simply scandalous the way that
thing acted! Every time he turned his head away
for a moment it added another ten cents to his
indebtedness! But he made the trip for a dollar
and twenty cents, not including the ten cents he
gave the driver, and was delighted to find that it
was still only ten minutes to four when he rang
the door-bell.</p>

<p>“Will you ask Gerald if I can see him, please?”</p>

<p>The man, who remembered Dan, smiled discreetly
and conducted him into the little reception
room. Then he went away, and Dan, left to the
depressing silence of the house, tried to nerve
himself for the encounter.</p>

<p>Gerald was upstairs in the library trying to
write a letter to his father. He had been home
three hours, had lunched all alone in the big
dining room, had unpacked his bag, and was now
far from happy. It promised to be very lonely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
there, with only the servants to talk to. There
were moments when he heartily wished himself
back at school, but he had no intention of returning.
His pride wouldn’t allow that. Just now
he was trying, in his half-written letter, to persuade
his father to let him join him abroad, something
he was quite certain his father would not do.
He had written a truthful, if somewhat biased,
account of the events leading to his flight from
school, and all the time he was wondering uneasily
what his father would think of him. He was
pretty sure his father wouldn’t insist on his returning
to Yardley, and he didn’t quite know
whether to be glad of this or sorry. If he didn’t
go back to school and didn’t join his father
abroad, what was to become of him? It wasn’t
at all likely that he would be allowed to remain
alone here with the servants. The only alternative
Gerald could think of was a visit to some
distant relations in Virginia. And that—why,
that would be worse than school.</p>

<p>He wondered whether Dan had discovered his
absence yet; wondered what he would think and
do; whether he would be sorry. Gerald accused
Dan of being tired of him, and he almost meant it,
but he knew well enough that Dan would feel badly
about his leaving. Probably there would be a letter
from Dan in the morning, thought Gerald,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
brightening up a little. That was something to
look forward to. He was mighty fond of Dan,
and if Dan had only not deserted him for Loring
and Tom Dyer— But that was all over with
now. He had tried to write a note to Dan before
leaving, but it had proved a difficult task, and he
had finally abandoned it. But he would write this
evening. He began to consider what he would
say. He would be very dignified in it. Dan must
understand that he was no longer a baby, and that
when he once made up his mind he stuck to it.
Perhaps he would begin the letter “Dear Vinton,”
just to show Dan that all was at an end between
them. Perhaps, however, Dan might not like that,
and would get huffy and not come to see him any
more! On second thoughts, he guessed he
wouldn’t start it that way. But he would let Dan
understand that it would be quite useless for the
latter to try and persuade him to return to Yardley.
Of course, if Dan cared to write to him now
and then, Gerald would be glad to hear what was
going on at school, and would reply and tell Dan
about the fine times he was having in New York.</p>

<p>Gerald paused there in his thoughts and looked
out of the two great, heavily-draped windows. It
was a gray afternoon, hinting of snow, and the
view of the roofs and chimneys was cheerless and
dispiriting. It suddenly came over him that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
hated New York and everything in it, and—and
yes, he did! He wished like anything that he was
back at Yardley!</p>

<p>“Mr. Vinton to see you, Mr. Gerald.”</p>

<p>“<em>What?</em>” cried Gerald, amazed and delighted.
“<em>Who</em>, Thomas?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Vinton, sir; Mr. Dan; the young gentleman
who—”</p>

<p>Gerald leaped from his chair and started toward
the door. Then he remembered. He stopped and
went back to his seat at the big, broad-topped
table.</p>

<p>“Ask Mr. Vinton to come up here, Thomas,”
he said with great dignity.</p>

<p>“Very good, sir,” replied Thomas impassively.
But outside in the hall he grinned.</p>

<p>Gerald waited with fast-beating heart. Dan
had come after him! Why had he done that unless—unless
he did care, after all? Perhaps,
though, the Faculty had sent him to bring him
back. Gerald hardened his heart again. He heard
the elevator door open and then quick steps came
along the corridor. Thomas held aside the curtains.</p>

<p>“Mr. Vinton,” he murmured.</p>

<p>“Hello, Dan,” greeted Gerald. He tried to
speak carelessly, but his voice trembled in spite
of his efforts. He got up leisurely from his chair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
and leaned against the table, smiling, awaiting
Dan.</p>

<p>Dan crossed the room briskly, his watch in his
hand. The time was five minutes to four.</p>

<p>“Hello,” he replied in business-like tones.
“Have you unpacked your things yet?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes.”</p>

<p>Dan turned. Thomas, who had lingered discreetly
at the door, was just disappearing.</p>

<p>“Wait a bit,” called Dan. “What’s his name?”
he asked Gerald.</p>

<p>“Thomas,” replied Gerald in surprise.</p>

<p>“Thomas, will you please pack Mr. Gerald’s
suit-case again as soon as you can? <a href="#i_fp098">He’s going
back with me on the five o’clock train.</a>”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 388px;">

</a><br />
<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_98">“‘He’s going back with me on the five o’clock train.’”</a></div>
</div>

<p>“Yes, sir,” replied Thomas.</p>

<p>“And is there anything we could have to take us
to the station, Thomas?”</p>

<p>“There’s the electric, sir. Shall I telephone for
that? About twenty minutes of five, sir?”
Thomas looked inquiringly from Dan to Gerald.
But it was Dan who was giving the orders.
Gerald’s presence of mind seemed to have deserted
him.</p>

<p>“Please do,” answered Dan. “Better say
twenty-five minutes of, though, Thomas. Thank
you.”</p>

<p>Thomas gave another doubtful glance at Gerald<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
and disappeared. The curtains fell behind him.
Dan turned to Gerald.</p>

<p>“There’s plenty of time to get that train,” he
said briskly. “It will get us in Wissining at
seven-thirty, and we can be back at school by a
quarter to eight. No one will know we’ve been
away unless we tell them.”</p>

<p>“I’m not going back,” said Gerald sullenly.</p>

<p>Dan paid no heed.</p>

<p>“What did you do such a stupid thing for,
Gerald?” he asked gently. “You might have got
into all sorts of trouble.”</p>

<p>“Trouble!” sneered Gerald. “I guess I’ve had
trouble, haven’t I? I guess a little more won’t
matter. Besides, they can’t do anything to me
here. I’ve left school.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, you haven’t. You can’t leave school
just by running away. Faculty can bring you back,
Gerald, if it wants to. Until your father withdraws
you from Yardley, you are a Yardley student
and under the control of the Faculty. Of
course I don’t know that they will want to bring
you back. They’ll probably just expel you. But
that won’t do. You don’t want them to do that.
Your father would be awfully broken up about it.
If you really must leave, the better way is to go
back now before they find it out, and then write to
your father to withdraw you. It will take a couple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
of weeks, but I guess you can wait that long, can’t
you?”</p>

<p>“I’m not going back,” reiterated Gerald stubbornly.
Dan made a gesture of impatience.</p>

<p>“You are going back,” he replied. “I’m going
to take you back. You’re going back if I have
to carry you all the way, and if it takes from now
till Sunday.”</p>

<p>The two boys looked at each other a moment.
Then Gerald’s eyes dropped. There was silence
for a moment. Then:</p>

<p>“They’ll know I ran away,” he muttered.</p>

<p>“No, they won’t; not if we go back on the five
o’clock train. Joe Chambers saw you, you know,
but I told him you were just going to Sound View.
He will forget all about it. Even if he suspects
he will never say anything. You’ll have to explain
missing recitations but you can do that all
right.”</p>

<p>There was another silence. Gerald dug holes
with the pen in the blotter. Finally:</p>

<p>“Faculty didn’t send you after me?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Great Scott, no!” answered Dan impatiently.
“I came as soon as I found out. I went to Sound
View first to make sure you weren’t there. Then
I caught the noon train.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see—” began Gerald.</p>

<p>“You don’t see what?” asked Dan as he paused.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t see why you take so much trouble,”
said Gerald.</p>

<p>“Why shouldn’t I?” asked Dan. “Wouldn’t
you do as much for me? If you thought I was
making a mighty big mistake and getting myself
into a heap of trouble and disappointing my folks,
wouldn’t you take a little trouble, Gerald?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but—”</p>

<p>“But nothing! It’s all settled. It’s almost
half-past, and I’m as hungry as a bear. Do you
suppose there’s anything to eat downstairs? I
didn’t have much money on hand and couldn’t afford
dinner on the train.”</p>

<p>“Of course there is,” cried Gerald. “I’ll tell
Thomas to get something. How much time is
there?”</p>

<p>“About twelve minutes before we need to start.
Here’s Thomas now.”</p>

<p>“The bag’s all ready, Mr. Gerald. I took it
down,” announced Thomas.</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” said Gerald eagerly. “And,
Thomas, Dan didn’t have any luncheon. See if
you can find something, and bring it up here right
away. There’s only about ten minutes.”</p>

<p>“Very good, sir. Some cold meat, sir, and a
glass of milk and some fruit? Shall I have them
make tea or coffee?”</p>

<p>“No, thanks,” replied Dan. “A slice of meat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
and some bread and butter will be fine; and the
milk. Much obliged, Thomas.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. I telephoned to the garage, sir, and
the brougham will be here at twenty-five minutes
of. But, begging pardon, sir, it won’t take more
than twelve minutes to get to the station.”</p>

<p>Thomas hurried noiselessly away.</p>

<p>“Have you got any money, Gerald?” asked
Dan.</p>

<p>Gerald took out his purse and examined the
contents.</p>

<p>“Only eight dollars,” he said.</p>

<p>“That’s plenty,” replied Dan. “I’ve only got
about three, and we’ll have to have supper on the
train.”</p>

<p>“That’ll be dandy!” cried Gerald. “Remember
the bully feed we had going home the last
time, Dan?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and I remember that we both ate too
much. You’d better finish that letter, Gerald, and
get Thomas to post it.”</p>

<p>Gerald hesitated a moment. Then he sat down
again, seized the pen and added three hurried
lines to his epistle.</p>

<p>“Dan just came, and wants me to go back. He
says no one will know anything about it. So I’m
going. I guess I was a fool. Lovingly, Gerald.”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X</a><br />
<small>A VISIT FROM KILTS</small></h2>
</div>


<p>It began to clear off about sunset time that
evening. To the westward, beyond Meeker’s
Marsh, beyond the distant rolling hills, a gleam of
crimson dispelled the gray for a brief moment.
Later, one by one, the stars came out, and a little
wind brushed the sky clear of clouds. It was a
cold, crisp evening, and Mr. McIntyre, looking out
for a moment before he drew the shades in his
study, felt the attractions of fresh air and exercise.
Getting into a heavy plaid ulster, settling his
funny round cloth hat on his head, and taking his
big Scotch oak walking stick in hand, Kilts turned
down his light and left the building.</p>

<p>He had been expecting some books by express
for several days, and now he would just walk down
to the station and see if they were there. He was
a good walker, and once clear of the school
grounds, he swung his stick and stepped out vigorously.
Overhead the millions of stars sparkled
whitely in a purple-black sky, shedding a faint
radiance over the snowy road and fields. Perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
memory brought recollections of just such tingling
nights at home in the lowlands of Scotland, for he
paused once for a long while at the edge of the
road and gazed off across the fields and sighed ere
he went on his way again.</p>

<p>At the station he found that his package had not
yet been received. As he turned to retrace his
steps a long whistle reached him through the
silence, and he paused at the corner of the station
to watch the train come in. He always enjoyed
that. He liked to see the glare sweep down the
track, listen to the mighty breath of the great iron
monster hurling itself out of the night, watch the
lighted windows as they flashed by, and wonder,
as folks will who are quite out of the world of
travel, who were beyond them and why. Even an
instructor of mathematics may have imagination.
But instead of thundering by, the train slackened
pace and came to a stop. Only a handful of
travelers alighted, and they were soon swallowed
up in the semi-darkness outside the radius of the
station lights.</p>

<p>But two of the alighting travelers interested
him. They were boys, and Kilts believed that he
recognized one of them. This one, the taller and
larger of the pair, passed not far from where
Kilts stood. He carried a suit-case into the station,
and presently emerged without it. Then he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
joined his companion, who was awaiting him in the
shadow at the farther end of the platform, and
together they passed around to where the carriages
stood. Kilts, with no idea of spying, but
merely to satisfy a mild curiosity, went around the
station at the other end and walked down the
asphalt there until he was within a few yards of
the carriage into which the two boys were clambering.
He was right. The larger of the two was
Vinton. He wondered where that youth had been
to be returning to school so long after supper time.
He recollected, too, that Vinton had been absent
from his class that afternoon. It was quite likely,
however, that he had permission to leave school,
Kilts reflected. Then the incident of the bag presented
itself. Why had Vinton left his bag at the
station, since he had ridden up in a carriage?
That looked suspicious. Kilts wasn’t one to look
for trouble, but it seemed to him that here was
something that would bear investigation. He resolved
to stop at the Office on his way to his room
and see whether Vinton had received permission
to sign off.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the carriage containing the boys
was rattling along over the snowy, rutted road.
Dan seemed suddenly very silent, and Gerald,
who, ever since his capitulation, had been in the
highest spirits, wondered, and presently asked the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
reason. After a moment’s hesitation Dan
answered:</p>

<p>“Kilts was down there at the station, Gerald,
and I’m pretty certain he recognized me.”</p>

<p>“Do you think he will tell?” asked Gerald
anxiously.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. He saw me take your bag into
the station. He was standing at the corner. I
didn’t notice him until I came out, and I wasn’t
certain then who he was. But he followed us
around to the carriage. I hope he didn’t see you
to know you.”</p>

<p>“So do I,” said Gerald. “He’s got it in for
me badly enough as it is. But I hope you won’t
get into trouble.”</p>

<p>“It won’t matter as long as he doesn’t find
out who you are,” Dan replied. Then he moved
forward and engaged the driver in conversation,
swearing that worthy to secrecy. They dismissed
the carriage at the foot of the hill and
walked up to school by way of the path. Their
precaution, however, proved unnecessary, for no
one was in sight as they made their way to Clarke.
Nor did they meet a single person on their way
up the stairs and through the hall. Dan heaved
a sigh of relief as he closed the room door behind
him. If Kilts didn’t prove troublesome
everything was all right.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>“Jove!” he said as he took off his coat and
looked curiously around the room. “It seems
like two or three days since I was here last.
And I’ve only been away eight hours! Get your
things off, Gerald, and we’ll get to work. What’s
going to trouble you most to-morrow? You
missed all your recitations to-day, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Gerald answered, “but algebra is the
only thing I’m afraid of.”</p>

<p>“All right. Get your books together and sit
down. We’ll go over the lesson together. I suppose
you’ll have about five pages more to-morrow,
eh?” Dan brought his chair around beside
Gerald’s. “This doesn’t look awfully difficult.
I don’t believe you really get your mind
on it, Gerald. Here, try this one and see how
it goes. While you’re doing it I’ll glance through
my French.”</p>

<p>They were both studying very hard when, some
twenty minutes later, there came a knock at the
door.</p>

<p>“Come,” called Dan, darting an apprehensive
glance at his companion. The door opened and
in walked Kilts. The boys jumped to their feet.</p>

<p>“Good evening,” said Dan. “Will you sit
down, sir?”</p>

<p>Kilts was tall and lean, his clean-shaven face
surmounted by an unruly shock of iron-gray<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
hair. His eyes—they might have been gray or
blue—were deeply set and sharp as two gimlets.
In age he was about fifty. He still wore his
queer old plaid ulster, without which he was
seldom seen abroad, no matter the season, and
carried his cloth hat and his stick in his hand.
He answered Dan’s greeting, bowed to Gerald and
took the chair offered, settling his stick across
his knees and laying his hat carefully atop. Then
with a glance about the room he smoothed one
lean cheek with his hand and fixed his gaze on
Dan.</p>

<p>“I’m not wanting to be here, Vinton,” he said
gravely but kindly. “But I’ve got a question to
ask you. I saw you at the station awhile ago,
eh?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” replied Dan.</p>

<p>“You’d been away?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Without permission?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>Kilts’ gaze moved to Gerald, who, in his chair
at the desk, was looking intently at his book.</p>

<p>“There was a boy with you?”</p>

<p>Dan hesitated a moment. Then:</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” he answered.</p>

<p>“Who was he?”</p>

<p>“I’d rather not say, Mr. McIntyre.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hum,” grunted Kilts. There was a moment
of silence. Gerald took up a pencil and began
scrawling nervously on the margin of his book.
Kilts cleared his throat. “Well, I’m sorry.
I’ll have to report this, Vinton. You understand
that?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. And—I’m sorry, too.”</p>

<p>“Well, well, maybe ’twill not be so bad. If
you’re sorry, now, likely—”</p>

<p>“What I meant was,” said Dan with a smile,
“that I was sorry for you, sir.”</p>

<p>“Eh? Sorry for me?” Mr. McIntyre’s thick,
grizzled eyebrows snapped together.</p>

<p>“Why, yes, sir. I know you don’t like to have
to report fellows,” answered Dan.</p>

<p>“Hum! Well, no more I do, Vinton.” Kilts
frowned, glanced at Gerald and glanced away
again. “Maybe there were circumstances, Vinton,
that extenuate your action,” he said finally
with a hopeful note in his voice. “Maybe, now,
’twas illness in the family; maybe ’twas necessary
for you to leave school suddenly—”</p>

<p>“It was, sir, very necessary,” replied Dan, “but
it had nothing to do with my family.”</p>

<p>“Well, well, maybe if you’d be telling me about
it, now—”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I can’t, sir,” said Dan regretfully.
“I wish I could. But it concerns someone else.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then you’re afraid you might get him into
trouble?”</p>

<p>“Y-yes, sir.” He paused. Then he said
frankly; “The fact, sir, is that it was necessary
for me to go to New York on the noon train; I
can’t tell you why it was necessary; and I only
learned that I had to go just a few minutes before
the train left. The train was moving when
I got on it. So there was no time to get permission
and sign off. I knew it was against the
rules, sir, but I couldn’t very well do anything
else.”</p>

<p>“Well, well, it’s too bad,” said Kilts, “too bad!
But I’ll speak a good word for you. I would not
be surprised if we were lenient, Vinton. As for
the other boy, now—” Kilts very carefully refrained
from even a glance toward Gerald—“why,
I don’t know who he may be, and so I don’t feel
called on to mention him. But he must promise
not to do anything of the kind again. Do you
think he will promise that?”</p>

<p>“I’m sure of it,” replied Dan earnestly and
gratefully.</p>

<p>Kilts nodded.</p>

<p>“Good! Then I’ll say good-night. I fear I’ve
kept you from study too long already.” Mr.
McIntyre took up his stick and hat and prepared
to rise, but Dan interrupted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>“Mr. McIntyre, sir, just a moment, please,” he
begged. “I—I—there’s something else, sir.”</p>

<p>Kilts laid his stick back across his knees and
threw aside his ulster again.</p>

<p>“Well?” he asked. Dan was silent a moment,
formulating his thoughts. Then:</p>

<p>“This other boy, sir,” he said, “it’s about
him.” Kilts nodded and Gerald stirred uneasily
at the table. “You don’t know who he is, sir,
as you say, and so he—he isn’t likely to come into
the affair. But I’d like to tell you a little about
him, as it can’t do him any harm.”</p>

<p>“Well, let me hear it,” said Kilts.</p>

<p>“I’ll call him—Moore,” said Dan, “but that
isn’t his name. He—he hasn’t been here very
long. This is his first school. He has always
studied with tutors and there are some things he
hasn’t got on very well with. And one of them is
mathematics.”</p>

<p>Kilts nodded inscrutably and Gerald leaned
closer to his book.</p>

<p>“He’s in algebra now, sir,” Dan continued,
“and he’s making hard work of it. At first he
really tried hard to understand it and get along,
but he couldn’t seem to make a go of it. Then he
got discouraged and I’m afraid he didn’t try so
hard. You see, sir, there were other things that
were—were unpleasant. Moore’s father is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
very prominent man and a very wealthy one.
And when Moore came here a good many of the
fellows took a dislike to him on that account. I
suppose they thought that Moore was stuck-up, although
he really isn’t. But he isn’t the sort of
fellow that makes friends easily, sir; he’s a little
bit shy. Well, some of the fellows tried to make it
unpleasant for him; called him ‘Miss Nancy’ and
‘Young Money-bags’ and things like that. Well,
that wasn’t pleasant, sir; and then he didn’t have
any friends, only two or three who had known
him before he entered school, and he began to
think he was imposed on. Then there was the
algebra. He couldn’t seem to make a go at that;
he fancied that the instructor was a bit down on
him, too, and you know that always discourages a
fellow, sir.”</p>

<p>“Ay,” grunted Kilts.</p>

<p>“So one day, when he didn’t have his lesson,
the instructor lost patience with him and ragged
him in front of the class and Moore answered
back. He hasn’t any excuse for that, sir, and
he’s sorry now. Of course he was reported and
he was placed on probation. Well, he ought to
have kept his nerve and steadied down. But instead
he sort of went up in the air; thought everyone
was down on him, nobody liked him, and that
he was pretty badly treated. So he made up his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
mind to—to cut it out—leave school, you know.”</p>

<p>“Hum,” muttered Kilts as Dan paused an
instant.</p>

<p>“The fact is, sir, he really thought that all he
had to do was to go home in order to leave school.
He didn’t understand that it was necessary for
his father to withdraw him. He believed that
when he left Wissining the Faculty had nothing
more to do with him. What I’m trying to show
you, sir, is that he didn’t mean to disobey rules,
but just quit altogether. Well, a friend of his
learned about it three hours after he had gone.
This friend knew that if the Faculty heard of it
they might expel him. So he—he took the first
train and went to the other fellow’s home and
found him and brought him back.”</p>

<p>“He was ready to come back?” asked Kilts.</p>

<p>“Yes. He wanted to come back, although he
pretended he didn’t. You see, sir, he—he had an
idea that this friend of his had—had grown tired
of him and didn’t care about him any more.
When he found that wasn’t so he was glad to
come back. If it would do any good he would go
to the Office and confess what he’d done, but it
might result in his being expelled. He doesn’t
need punishment, sir, for he’s had a pretty tough
time of it already, and he won’t ever do anything
of the kind again. I’ve already promised that for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
him,” added Dan with a smile at the professor.</p>

<p>For a moment there was silence. Kilts, leaning
back in his chair, observed Dan steadily out
of his sharp eyes. Dan stood the ordeal without
a tremor. Then:</p>

<p>“And why have you told me this, Vinton?”
asked Kilts suddenly.</p>

<p>“Because Moore is back here now, sir, and he intends
to do the best he can in everything, especially
algebra. And I wanted you to know, sir,
that if he doesn’t get on very well it isn’t because
he isn’t trying. I’m going to help him all I can,
sir,” said Dan earnestly. “I was going over the
lesson with him when you—”</p>

<p>Gerald’s pencil rolled to the floor and Dan
brought himself up with a jerk. But the only
sign from Kilts was a momentary twinkle of the
deep-set eyes.</p>

<p>“And so he thinks the instructor is down on
him, eh?” asked Mr. McIntyre.</p>

<p>“He did think so, but I—but his friend made
him understand that he was wrong.”</p>

<p>“Really, and how did his friend do that? What
did he say now, Vinton?”</p>

<p>“He said,” replied Dan gravely, “that the instructor
was hard on fellows when he thought
they weren’t trying to get on; that he was a good
deal like anyone else, sir; had a temper—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hum!” grunted Kilts.</p>

<p>“And lost it sometimes, like most folks. But
that he was square and just and would treat a
fellow white if the fellow showed that he was trying
to do his work.”</p>

<p>Kilts seemed for the moment at a loss for something
to say. Then he cleared his throat.</p>

<p>“Well, and what did he say?” asked Kilts, with
a nod toward Gerald.</p>

<p>“You mean what did <em>Moore</em> say?” asked Dan
politely.</p>

<p>“Yes, Moore; what did he say?”</p>

<p>“Well, he didn’t say much, sir; but he understood.”</p>

<p>“You think he did, eh? Think he believed
you—I mean this friend of his?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, I’m quite sure he did.”</p>

<p>Kilts was silent a moment. Finally:</p>

<p>“Then you tell him that that instructor will
give him fair-play. Tell him to do his best and
not be touchy when the instructor loses that bad
temper of his.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir, I will,” answered Dan gratefully.
Mr. McIntyre got up with a grunt that
might have meant most anything and began to
button his ulster about his gaunt form. In the
process his feet wandered toward the table.
Gerald kept his head over his book.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ah—hum—that your algebra, Pennimore?”
asked Kilts, pointing at the book.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” murmured Gerald without looking
up.</p>

<p>“Been—been looking it over, have you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, a little.”</p>

<p>“Hm. I didn’t see you in class this morning,
did I?”</p>

<p>“Er—no, sir.”</p>

<p>“Thought so. Well, to-morrow we take—let
me see.” Kilts laid his stick and hat on the
table and leaned over the book. “Yes, we take
four pages and a half. To here. Mark it there.
That’s right. Had any trouble with it so far?”</p>

<p>Gerald shot a bewildered look across at Dan’s
smiling countenance and read reassurance.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, I have. I—I don’t seem to understand
it, sir,” he added pathetically.</p>

<p>“Because you don’t try to!” said Kilts with
a trace of asperity. “You’ve just made up your
mind that algebra is something you don’t need
and that you’ll just fiddle through it the easiest
way; just learn enough to get your marks. I
know. Half you fellows think that. You don’t
any of you understand that mathematics is a
grand study. Why, you talk about romance, my
boy! Here it is, right here!” And he thumped
the open book with the back of one big hand.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
“The Romance of Figures! Why, ’tis a wonderful,
marvelous thing, my lad, this mathematics.
’Tis as full of romance and beauty as a garden
of flowers! You don’t look beyond the surface;
you don’t think! An’ ye go at it right, laddie,
with open eyes and an open heart ye’ll love it!”</p>

<p>Kilts stopped and shook his head patiently.</p>

<p>“But ye won’t believe me. I know. You’re
like the rest. You think I’m just an old fool with
a hobby for figures, a dried-up old curmudgeon
with no feelings, and no manners—”</p>

<p>“Oh, please, sir!” begged Gerald miserably.</p>

<p>“There, there, laddie! ’Twas ill said! Think
no more of it!” Kilts patted the boy’s shoulder
and smiled down kindly at his distressed face.
“Now show me what you don’t understand.” He
looked around for a chair, and Dan, anticipating
his want, placed one for him. Kilts produced
his glasses from his pocket, unceremoniously
pushed the litter of books and papers away from
in front of him so that several would have fallen
to the floor had not Dan rescued them in time and
drew the algebra toward him. “What is it that’s
puzzling that young brain of yours, my boy?”</p>

<p>Dan went quietly to his chair across the table
and bent over his French. But he didn’t do much
studying. The voices of Kilts and Gerald broke
the silence at intervals, Gerald’s apologetic, inquiring,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
Kilts’ patient, persuasive. Half an hour
went by. Then:</p>

<p>“What did I say?” exclaimed Mr. McIntyre
triumphantly. “Concentrate, concentrate, Pennimore!
Put your mind on what you’re doing.
There’s not an example in that whole book that
won’t come just as easy as that one has, if you
put your mind to it. Look now, laddie, that’s
not just a mess of little figures; ’tis a story, a
little romance waiting for you to translate it.
Remember that, lad, and maybe ’twill come
easier.”</p>

<p>“Thank you very much, sir,” said Gerald gratefully.
“I—I don’t think I’ll have so much
trouble after this, sir. Anyhow, I’m going to try
very hard, sir.”</p>

<p>“That’s right, that’s right,” answered Kilts,
patting him on the arm as he lifted his long length
out of the chair. “Put your mind on it; concentrate,
concentrate! You’ll do finely yet. Good-night,
good-night, boys.”</p>

<p>“Good-night, sir,” they echoed. Dan went to
the door with the instructor and held it open.</p>

<p>“I’ll report to the Office to-morrow, sir,” he
said.</p>

<p>“Eh? Well, well, I wouldn’t do that,” said
Kilts slowly. There was a twinkle in his eye.
“Wait ’till you hear, Vinton, wait ’till you hear.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
He lowered his voice. “Fact is, my boy, I’m getting
along and my memory isn’t what it used to
be. I might forget; there’s no telling. Yes, I
might forget.”</p>

<p>And Kilts went off down the corridor. Dan
thought that he heard a chuckle.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI</a><br />
<small>HOCKEY AT BROADWOOD</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Kilts must have forgot. For although Dan
waited, the summons from the Office didn’t come;
and what might have resulted in a very serious
piece of business for both Dan and Gerald brought
no disagreeable consequences. More than that,
the episode actually benefited Gerald, and in
more ways than one. It brought him and Dan
closer together, increasing their companionship;
it cleared the air, Gerald wisely deciding to wipe
out old scores and start again with a clean slate;
it worked an immediate change in the boy’s attitude
toward Mr. McIntyre in particular and
school authority in general; and it brought about
a more sympathetic relationship between Gerald
and mathematics.</p>

<p>I don’t mean to imply that Gerald at once became
the star student in his algebra class. He
never reached any such pinnacle of success. He
never succeeded in viewing algebra with Mr. McIntyre’s
enthusiastic eyes. But he put his mind
on it with good results and soon found that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
was not the dreadful bogy he had fancied. Perhaps
the fact that he had discovered his instructor
to be human and likable and sympathetic had
a good deal to do with his success, and lots of
times when he would have gladly thrown aside
his algebra in despair he pegged away at it from
the mere desire to please Kilts and show him
that he was not ungrateful. And the instructor
showed that he understood and was pleased. If
the truth were known, Kilts gave more credit
to the boy who worked hard for his D than to
the boy who, with a natural aptitude for mathematics,
secured his B with scant labor. But Kilts
showed Gerald no favors when it came to marks.
No one who knew Kilts would have expected it.
Nor did Gerald. Gerald knew that his D’s—and
very occasional C’s—were his deserts, neither
more nor less. But with algebra no longer haunting
him like a nightmare, his other studies came
easier, and Gerald began to think that perhaps,
after all, there was a place for him in the school
life.</p>

<p>Dan had, you may be certain, given an account
of Gerald’s attempted escape from his troubles
to Alf and Tom. The comment of each was typical.
Alf, with his impatience for all things weak
and futile, immediately dubbed Gerald “a silly
ass.” Tom, big-hearted and sympathetic, declared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
that he had showed grit if not judgment.</p>

<p>“Of course it was a foolish thing to do,” he
said, “but lots of chaps wouldn’t have had the
courage to do it. They’d have just sat around
and been miserable and unhappy.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” said Alf, “but if Faculty
had caught him it would have been all up. It was
the craziest thing I ever heard of. Somebody’s
got to pump some sense into that kid, Dan.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he won’t cut up that way again,” Dan replied.
“I think it’s done him good. And old
Kilts acting the way he did helped a lot. Gerald
had got it into his head that Kilts and Collins and
the whole Faculty were sitting up nights trying
to devise ways to make trouble for him. Now he
thinks that Kilts is just about right, and that
has given him hope for the rest of them. I’m
not sure, but I think Gerald’s going to settle down
now and take things easier.”</p>

<p>“Sure to,” said Tom. “It’s like Cæsar Augustus.”</p>

<p>“Who’s he?” asked Dan and Alf in a breath.</p>

<p>“He <em>was</em> a dog. Now he’s a dog-angel. I had
him when I was just a youngster.”</p>

<p>“Listen to the doddering, decrepit old idiot,”
observed Alf in an aside.</p>

<p>“He was just a puppy when I got him; about
three months old. Don’t ask me what sort of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
dog he was, for no one ever knew. In fact, it
was such a mystery that no one ever dared to
guess. Well, Cæsar Augustus used to trouble
about the cat when he first came. The cat was
an old, experienced codger and used to sit on the
kitchen windowsill, where the cook kept her
geraniums, and blink and purr all day long.
Cæsar Augustus lived under the stove, except
when I dragged him out by the nape of the neck
and poured milk down his throat. For we just
had to make him eat. He’d sit there with his
head sticking out and watch the cat for hours,
and tremble and whine and get thin and pine
away. You see, that cat worried him silly. He
couldn’t understand her; didn’t know what she
was made for, what she was good for or anything
else. That went on for about a month. Then,
driven to desperation one day, Cæsar Augustus
crawled out from under the stove and went for the
cat. Cook and I rescued him after he’d made
about six trips around the room with the cat on
his back. We washed the blood off, smeared his
wounds with mutton tallow and fed him raw steak
to heal his sorrow. Sorrow! He didn’t have
any! He was happy as a lark, rolled over and
played, ate his steak as though he’d been living
on it for years, and was a changed dog. Never
had an unhappy moment afterwards.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well,” laughed Alf, “and what’s the moral—the
lesson to be derived from your charming
tale?”</p>

<p>“The moral,” replied Tom, “is; When anything
troubles you take a fall out of it. It may
hurt for a while, but you’re a lot better for it
afterwards.”</p>

<p>“And you think Gerald’s like Cæsar Augustus?”
asked Dan.</p>

<p>“Sure. The whole scheme of things here was
troubling him. He didn’t understand authority;
didn’t know whether it could bite or not. So he
had a show-down. Now he knows where he
stands. He will come out from under the stove
now; you see if he doesn’t.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you’re an idiot,” said Alf. “The trouble
is with him, Dan, he thinks he’s a blooming philosopher.
But he may be right—for once. I don’t
know. Anyhow, you tell Gerald to come over
Saturday for his boxing lesson.”</p>

<p>“Well, but there’s no reason why you should
be bored with him every week, Alf. If he wants
any more lessons I’ll attend to him. I don’t
know anything about it, but he will be just as
satisfied, I dare say.”</p>

<p>“You think so, do you?” asked Alf indignantly.
“Let me tell you that that kid is going to be a
boxer. Why, he knows more about using his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
hands now than half the fellows in school. Don’t
you worry about my being bored, old man. In a
month or so I’ll have to go my hardest to keep
him from knocking my head off!”</p>

<p>“Why doesn’t he get to know more fellows?”
puzzled Tom.</p>

<p>“I don’t know, really,” Dan answered. “He’s
sort of quiet until you know him real well, but I
should think he’d get acquainted better. He
meets a good many fellows every day in class
and around school. I don’t believe he has more
than a nodding acquaintance with any of the fellows
at his table. I don’t know what the trouble
is.”</p>

<p>“He isn’t a good ‘mixer,’” said Alf. “What
we’ll have to do is to take him in hand, fellows.
Look here, Dan, bring him up to Cambridge Saturday
night for the debate, and we’ll introduce
him to a few fellows. And Tom can have him
over to Oxford now and then. The rules won’t
let us introduce him more than once a month, but
if Tom takes him to one meeting and we take him
to another that’ll be twice.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to get him into Cambridge,” said Dan,
“but the election doesn’t come until May, does
it?”</p>

<p>“No,” answered Tom. “But while you’re
about it, why don’t you try and get the poor chap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
into a decent society? If you like, I’ll propose
him for Oxford.”</p>

<p>A howl arose from the others, both of whom
were members of Cambridge, and in a moment
Gerald’s welfare was lost sight of in a good-natured
but fierce discussion of the relative merits
of the rival debating societies.</p>

<p>Gerald was quite pleased at the idea of accompanying
Dan and Alf to one of the Saturday
night meetings of the Cambridge Debating
Society, and thoroughly enjoyed the proceedings
when he went. The two societies had rooms on
the top floor of Oxford Hall. Actually, there was
not much to choose between them, although the
members of each could flaunt all sorts of arguments
in favor of their own particular choice.
Cambridge had of late years won a majority of
the Inter-Society Debates, held in December and
June of each year. But Oxford fellows made
light of that claim to superiority and pointed out
with pride that Oxford was the older society by
a dozen years. Also, they were sure to tell you,
Oxford had a real combination billiard and pool
table! Whereupon, if you owed allegiance to the
Light Blue, you scoffed and declared that the table
was so old and its legs so weak that fellows had
to hold it in their laps while they played on it!</p>

<p>Secret organizations were prohibited at Yardley—although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
now and then faint whispers of
such organizations were wafted about—and so almost
every fellow sooner or later accepted an invitation
from Oxford or Cambridge. While they
were supposed to be debating clubs, and in a
measure justified the title, they were in reality
far more social in character. The rooms of each
society were comfortably furnished and the fellows
met there during the day, but especially in
the evenings, to chat, read, or play games. The
debates took place on Saturday evenings, and it
was to one of these that Gerald was taken.</p>

<p>On this occasion the subject in discussion was
the elective system in colleges. It seemed something
of a shame to Gerald that the presidents
of the principal universities were not present,
for he was certain some very brilliant things were
said on both sides. Personally his sympathies
were with the contestants who spoke in favor of
the system, but that was because he had been introduced
to Oliver Colton, last Fall’s football
captain, by Dan before the meeting, and Colton
was the most brilliant speaker for the affirmative
side.</p>

<p>After the debate was over and the Judge, Doctor
Frye, professor of physics, had rendered his
decision in favor of the negative side, the chairs
were pushed aside and the gathering became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
purely social and very informal. There was an
impromptu concert by several members of the
Musical Club, but those who didn’t want to listen
didn’t have to, although Gerald thought them
very impolite for talking while the music was
going on. He was introduced to some of the
fellows, not many, for Dan and Alf didn’t want
to appear to be forcing the boy on their acquaintances.
But Gerald met some four or five chaps
who were worth knowing, and they were each
quite as polite and interested as the occasion demanded.
On the whole, he had a very pleasant
evening and began to look forward eagerly to the
time when he might join Cambridge.</p>

<p>But a week later he found himself in a quandary.
For Tom Dyer took him to a meeting of
Oxford, and Gerald had just as good a time—perhaps
a little better, since Tom devoted every
moment of his time to putting him at his ease
and entertaining him; and Tom was so big and
jolly and sympathetic that Gerald, who had theretofore
been somewhat in awe of him, fell a captive
at once. Here, too, he met new fellows. Joe
Chambers, to whom he had never been introduced
but who always spoke to him, it being part of
Joe’s policy to know everyone, was especially
kind and invited him around to his room. And
lest Joe might forget the invitation, Tom took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
Gerald around there the next afternoon. There
were three other fellows on hand when they arrived
and Gerald, partly by keeping still and not
appearing “fresh” or assertive, made a good impression
on them. But, as I have said, this visit
to Oxford left him in a quandary. He told Dan
that he didn’t know which society he liked best
and was so troubled about it that Dan comforted
him by pointing out that he still had three months
in which to make up his mind and that it was
really idle to bother his head about it now.</p>

<p>Meanwhile February wore away with its rough
winds and clouded skies, and Gerald’s period of
probation came to an end, not in time, however,
to allow him to get back his place on the Clarke
Hall hockey team. But if he couldn’t play he
could look on and shout, and he did both during
the three matches played. Clarke held her own
during the first two contests and was picked by
the School at large to win the championship. But
her pride met a fall when she faced Dudley in the
deciding game, for Dudley romped away an easy
winner, much to Gerald’s sorrow.</p>

<p>The ’Varsity Hockey Team won and lost about
equally. The team got to be something of a joke
that year, and it was a common thing to hear a
fellow shout to another; “Oh, Jim, come on and
let’s go down and see the hockey team lose!”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
Just what the matter was no one seemed to know,
although there were plenty of theories advanced.</p>

<p>The players were quite as good as those of the
year before, when Yardley had won seven games
out of nine played, and her schedule was no more
difficult. The captain was popular and worked
hard. But the fellows got injured in the most
unlikely ways just before a game, or a strange
demoralization would seize upon the team at some
critical point in a contest, or one of the stars
would lose his temper for no good reason and get
sent off by the referee just when his services
were most needed.</p>

<p>Dan had had hopes of trying for the team at first
and Alf had encouraged him. Alf played point
on the team and was one of the steadiest of the
seven. But a few days on the river had convinced
Dan that he was too poor a performer on
runners to make the hockey team, this year at
least. He was very uncertain on his skates and
was more often losing his balance or denting the
ice than really skating. In the end, Alf was
forced to admit that it would be as well for him
to wait another year before trying for the team.</p>

<p>The final game was with Broadwood Academy
and was played on the rival’s rink at Broadwood.
Dan and Gerald and Tom were among the sixty-odd
boys who accompanied the team. Broadwood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
has been Yardley’s principal rival for many
years. To reach Broadwood from Wissining you
cross the carriage bridge beyond the station and,
keeping to the right, take the county road which
runs inland and westward toward the hills. The
academy lies some three miles from the depot at
Greenburg and is perched on the slope of a long,
wooded hill, with fields and farm below it and
acres of forest behind. It is a comparatively new
school and its buildings are handsome and up-to-date.
Broadwood usually has about two hundred
and thirty students, and a large proportion of
her graduates enter Princeton.</p>

<p>The Yardley contingent traveled thither in two
big “barges,” and had a merry time of it. The
team went to the gymnasium to change their
clothes, and the rest of the party wandered around
the grounds sight-seeing. It is part of the Yardley
creed to pretend to find no good in Broadwood,
and so even the best of the buildings received
disparaging criticisms. Of course, if there
happened to be Broadwood fellows within hearing
distance the criticisms were subdued; good
taste demanded that much. But when their remarks
could not be overheard the Yardley visitors
indulged in sarcasm and disparagement to their
hearts’ content.</p>

<p>“What’s this hovel?” asked Joe Chambers as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
the party drew up in front of Knowles Hall, the
finest building of all. Someone supplied the desired
information.</p>

<p>“Knowles Hall?” said Joe. “Well, Knowles
ought to try again. Looks like a cross between
a circus tent and a Turkish mosque. Get on to
the lanterns in front, fellows! Aren’t they the
limit?”</p>

<p>“Don’t make light of them,” begged some one.</p>

<p>“What is it, anyhow? A dormitory or a recitation
hall?” asked Joe.</p>

<p>“Search me,” answered Paul Rand. “There’s
a Broadwood fellow over there. Let’s ask him.
He probably Knowles Hall about it.”</p>

<p>While the laughter elicited by this witticism was
still convulsing the crowd, four Broadwood fellows
came through the doorway and descended
the steps, viewing the sightseers with surprise
and curiosity.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s certainly a beautiful building,”
said Joe loudly and earnestly.</p>

<p>“I never saw a finer one,” agreed Rand. “But
then, Broadwood is full of beautiful things.”</p>

<p>“It’s a real privilege to live here,” continued
Joe. “No wonder we see so many, many happy
faces!”</p>

<p>The Broadwood youths frowned suspiciously
as they passed, and one of them let fall a remark<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
about “fresh guys.” But Yardley only chuckled.</p>

<p>“I think it’s a very fine building,” ventured
Gerald in a puzzled tone to Tom Dyer. Tom
laughed.</p>

<p>“It is,” he whispered, “but you’re not supposed
to say so!”</p>

<p>The party passed on to view the gymnasium
and one of the fellows expressed a desire to see
the trophy room.</p>

<p>“I’ve heard a lot about the Broadwood trophy
room,” he explained. “They say there’s a fine
collection of croquet balls and checkers in it!”</p>

<p>While this joke was being passed around, the
two hockey teams emerged, and the Yardley crowd
followed them down to the rink, an expanse of
ice secured by flooding the tennis courts. That
game was a farce in more ways than one. In the
first place the ice was rotten and before the game
was five minutes old the surface was badly cut
up and covered with loose ice and slush. Broadwood
showed herself more accustomed to such
conditions than her rival, and wasn’t greatly
bothered. On the other hand, Yardley, used to
thick, hard ice of the river, floundered about, as
Tom said, like hens in a snow bank. Then, to
make matters worse, Yardley was outplayed from
the first whistle, and it was only the really phenomenal
work of her goal-tender that prevented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
her from being literally swamped in the first half.</p>

<p>The Yardley contingent lined one side of the
rink and waved its blue flags and cheered nobly,
but the green of Broadwood was in the ascendant
to-day. The first half ended with the score three
to one for Broadwood, a score that didn’t begin
to show the real superiority of the Green. Alf
perched himself on the barrier beside Dan and
Gerald and Tom, rueful and weary. Dan helped
him into his sweater.</p>

<p>“Fine, isn’t it?” asked Alf with a grin.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” ventured Gerald anxiously.</p>

<p>“Oh, they’re playing all around us. And look
at the ice! Did you ever see such a mess? Why,
you can’t slide the puck at all; you’ve got to lift
it every time. And your skates just sink into the
ice. Still, we couldn’t lick them, anyway, to-day.
Those forwards of theirs are dandies, every one
of them. Their goal isn’t much, I guess, but
the trouble is we can’t break through to try him.”</p>

<p>“You made one goal, though,” said Dan encouragingly.
Alf shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“It was just luck,” he said. “I’ll bet we don’t
score again!”</p>

<p>If Dan had accepted the wager he would have
lost. Yardley became utterly demoralized in the
last half; every fellow played for himself and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
team work was quite forgotten. The result was
that Broadwood, amidst the cheers of her adherents,
piled up six more goals, and the disastrous
contest ended with the score nine to one
in favor of the Green. Broadwood cheered Yardley
and Yardley cheered Broadwood and the
visitors ran for the gymnasium. The crowd of
Yardley “rooters” were sad and subdued. Joe
Chambers produced the only laugh from the end
of the game to the time they were rattling homeward
in the barges when he declaimed mournfully:</p>

<small>YARDLEY GETS REVENGE</small></h2>
</div>


<p>But Yardley found her revenge in another
form of sport.</p>

<p>Tom had succeeded where Paul Rand had failed.
Although the managers of the rival basket-ball
teams had failed to reach an agreement the
captains were more successful. Tom had offered
to let Broadwood fix her own dates and name her
own grounds for the series of three games, and
Broadwood had promptly got over her peevishness.
The Broadwood captain had politely replied
that his team would play the first game at
Broadwood, the second at Yardley and the deciding
game, in case of a tie, at Broadwood. And
he fixed the dates to please himself, requiring that
all three contests take place inside of a fortnight
in early March. Rand had held up his
hands in holy horror when Tom had shown him
the letter and declared that Tom was several
sorts of a fool to accept such arrangements.</p>

<p>“It’s their turn to play the odd game here,”
declared Rand. “Besides, who ever heard of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
playing the first two games within three days of
each other?”</p>

<p>“Oh, what does it matter?” asked Tom. “We
want to play them, don’t we? Then what’s the
use of haggling about it? I’ll play them any
place and any time, just as I said I would.”</p>

<p>“But,” began Rand, a trifle haughtily, “as
manager—”</p>

<p>“Paul,” said Tom, “you’re a good fellow, all
right, but you’re a mighty poor manager.”</p>

<p>And Paul, who, after all, had plenty of sense,
recognized the justice of the charge and said no
more.</p>

<p>So one Wednesday evening a large part of
Yardley Hall School rode over to Broadwood and
saw Tom’s five defeat the green-stockinged warriors
in their own gymnasium by a score of twelve
to nine and came triumphantly home again in the
moonlight chanting pæans of victory and making
night hideous.</p>

<p>“Well, that was going some!” declared Alf
radiantly on the way home. “On their own floor,
too!”</p>

<p>“And when they come over here Saturday night
you’ll see us do worse than that to them,” said
Tom grimly. “There isn’t going to be any third
game in the series this year.”</p>

<p>And there wasn’t.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>Broadwood sent over a good big number of
“rooters” armed with flags, who did noble work
with their lungs. But as Yardley had turned out
almost to a man, the odds were too great in a
contest of noise. The gymnasium was packed
and jammed, downstairs and up, and the singing
and cheering began half an hour before the
time set for the game. Broadwood used one of
her football songs with good effect. The verses
didn’t amount to much, but the refrain, howled by
a hundred throats, was always effective:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Oh, what’ll we do to Yardley, to Yardley, to Yardley?<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Oh, what’ll we do to Yardley?<br /></span>
<span class="i7">(An eloquent and dramatic pause.)<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Well, really, I’d rather not say!”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And Yardley hurled back one of her own gridiron
odes defiantly:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Old Yardley has the men, my boy,<br /></span>

<p>Tom, captain and center, played the game of
his school life that night. If one imagined him
slow, one had only to watch him for a moment on
a gymnasium floor between the baskets. He was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
the quickest slow person that ever imitated a
streak of lightning! And he pulled his team
along with him in a way that was beautiful to behold.
Things began to happen right at the start.
The first basket came less than a minute after
the whistle had blown, resulting from a wonderful
rush down the floor by Tom and Derrick followed
by a swift shot by the latter. Then Broadwood
gathered herself together and tightened up
her defense. Her men for a while covered so
closely that not even Tom could get away, and
the ball hovered around the middle of the floor.
Then one of the Yardley players was caught holding
and Broadwood, amidst shouts of joy from
the wavers of the green flags, scored a goal from
foul. For several minutes there was no more
scoring. Twice Yardley had the ball under her
rival’s basket. Once a poor shot lost them the
score. The next time Broadwood “mixed it up”
so strenuously that there was no chance to shoot.
Then a Broadwood boy stole the ball and charged
down the hall almost alone. But the Yardley defense
was not napping, and a blue-shirt charged
into the enemy just in time to spoil the throw.
After that Broadwood seemed to get rattled, for
Yardley scored thrice from the floor, one basket
by Tom being sent from almost half the length of
the gymnasium and bringing the supporters of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
the home team to their feet with a roar of delight.
The half ended with the score eight to one, and it
looked like a pretty certain thing for the Yardley
five.</p>

<p>But Broadwood still shouted and sang defiantly,
and when the teams lined up and play began again
it was soon evident that the Broadwood coach
had been saying things out there in the dressing
room. For Broadwood’s team play began to be
in evidence again, and although for a while she
played more on the defense than attack, it was
plain to be seen that Yardley would have to work
hard to keep from being scored on.</p>

<p>Broadwood’s chance came in the middle of the
period. A well-arranged rush down the floor,
with all her attack taking part, brought the ball
to Yardley’s basket and, although the guards
rushed to the rescue, a tall Broadwood youth
managed to shake himself free, reach up, and almost
drop the ball through the mesh. With the
score eight to three, Broadwood felt encouraged
and started in to add to her tally. But Yardley
played desperately, if somewhat wildly, and although
Broadwood was now making raid after
raid on the Blue’s goal, all her tries were spoiled.
But Yardley twice infringed the rules and from
her two free tries Broadwood secured one goal,
increasing her total to four. This was followed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
by a double foul, a Broadwood and a Yardley
player becoming rather too enthusiastic in their
efforts, and again Broadwood added one to her
tally, Yardley missing the basket by a bare inch.
That made the score five to eight, and Broadwood’s
cheers broke forth anew and a little forest
of green flags appeared. The ball went back to
center. Tom clapped his hands.</p>

<p>“Now then, fellows, settle down! No more
fouls! Break this up!”</p>

<p>The big round clock over the running gallery
showed that something like six minutes remained
as the referee blew his whistle again and the ball
shot into the air. Both centers leaped and struck,
and a small Broadwood youth caught the ball as
it came down near the side-line, squirmed away
from his opponent, dribbled a few steps, and
passed across the floor. But the next man was
closely covered and the ball bounded away from
him and popped into the eager hands of Tom.</p>

<p>“Cover up! Cover up!” shrieked the Broadwood
captain, as he bounded toward Tom. Tom
side-stepped and let his antagonist stagger by.
Then a short pass to Derrick, and the two started
down the floor toward the Green’s goal. Derrick
passed back and Tom caught the ball in
spite of the opponents who were massing about
him, wheeled, feinted, dashed through the mêlée,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
dribbled, and then threw to a blue-shirted youth
waiting near Broadwood’s goal. It was a hard,
fast throw, but the youth caught it, struggled a
moment under the attack of his adversary, broke
loose, and threw somewhat wildly for the basket.
The ball struck the frame above and came down
into the waiting hands of Derrick. Two Broadwood
fellows hurled themselves toward him but
not before the ball was out of his hands again.
There was a moment of suspense while it rolled leisurely,
undecidedly around the hoop. Then in it
dropped, through the mesh and back to the floor
amidst the triumphant yells of Yardley. And
the two excited youngsters operating the score-board
in the balcony almost fell over the railing
in their endeavor to change the Yardley 8 for a 10.</p>

<p>Gerald, who, with Dan and Alf and Joe Chambers,
had been early on the scene and had secured
seats in the front row on the floor a yard back
of the boundary line, let out such a shriek of delight
that everyone in the hall heard and laughed.
Covered with confusion then, he sank back between
Dan and Joe. But no one paid any more
attention to him and his blushes soon passed.
He was wildly excited, and once Dan had had to
hold him into his seat for fear he would go toppling
out onto the floor under the players’ feet.</p>

<p>The ball was centered once more and the clock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
proclaimed but four minutes of playing time left.
Broadwood became desperate. Capturing the
ball near the middle of the floor, she tried a long
shot that struck the frame of the basket but didn’t
go through. Again she got the leather, and this
time she tried to reach scoring distance, but the
Yardley defense was so tight that she lost
the ball. Then came another rush down the floor,
with the Yardley team working together like
clockwork, and another goal thrown by the Blue’s
left-guard. After that the visitors went to pieces.
In their frantic endeavors to score they failed to
cover closely and became so strenuous that two
fouls were called on them in succession, neither of
which Yardley was able to convert into points.
Then, with a little more than a minute to play,
Yardley began to sweep her rival off her feet and
to score almost at will. One goal—another—a
third from a difficult angle at the side of the hall,
and Yardley’s score was growing by leaps and
bounds. Tom dropped out now and one by one
the substitutes were put in, in order that they
might get their letters. And then, with a blue-shirted
youth poised for a shot, the whistle blew
and pandemonium reigned. Up on the score-board
the final figures stood 18 to 5.</p>

<p>Gerald found himself one of a seething, pushing,
shouting mass of spectators out on the floor.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
Dan and Alf and Joe were lost to sight. The
players, after cheering for Broadwood, were trying
to reach the dressing room uncaptured. But
none escaped. Each one was caught and borne
shoulder-high from the hall. Gerald felt someone
smash into him from behind, turned, and
found Derrick struggling with a group of enthusiastic
captors. They were trying to lift him
onto their shoulders, but the crowd was packed
so tightly that for a moment their efforts were
in vain. Derrick, laughing and fighting, was almost
squirming away when a big youth seized him
around the waist and shouted to Gerald to catch
hold. Gerald caught hold, somehow, somewhere,
and the next thing he knew he and the big fellow
were staggering through the jam with Derrick on
their shoulders and a happy mob of fellows
around them. Down the hall to the stairway they
went, Gerald panting, struggling to keep his feet,
and immensely proud.</p>

<p>And the next morning, when he awoke, he wondered
why his back and arms ached so!</p>

</div>


<p>March came blustering in with cloudy skies and
cold winds. But in a week it had quite changed
its tune. One morning Dan awoke to find the sunlight
streaming through the front windows and
a new quality in the air. For a moment he lay
under the covers and wondered sleepily what it
was that brought the strange stirring to his heart.
Then he was out of bed, had thrown the window
wide open, and was leaning forth in his pajamas
breathing in the warm, moist air. Spring had
come in the night. All about him were signs.
Above was a mellow blue sky dotted with little
feathery white clouds. In the roadway beneath
the snow was melting fast and the gutters were
astream with trickling water. Even the stone
window coping under his hands seemed somehow
to hint of Spring; it was warm to his fingers and
moist where a little rim of ice had melted. There
was a faint, heart-cheering aroma of brown earth
and greening sod released from their winter coverings.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
Dan gave a shout and drew his head in
long enough to awaken Gerald.</p>

<p>“Get up!” he cried. “It’s Spring, Gerald!
Get up and hear the birdies sing!”</p>

<p>And the birds really were singing; or, at least,
they were chattering happily and noisily, which,
as they were only little brown sparrows, was
about all that could be expected of them. Gerald
put a sleepy head alongside of Dan’s and sniffed
the air greedily.</p>

<p>“Doesn’t it smell great?” he sighed. “Let’s
get dressed and go out. What time is it?”</p>

<p>“Ten minutes to seven,” answered Dan.
“Let’s go for a walk before Chapel. What do
you say?”</p>

<p>For answer Gerald raced to the washstand and
was soon splashing busily, and in ten minutes
they were flying down stairs with Spring in their
veins. Once off the stone walks it was gloriously
soft and “mushy,” as Dan said. They had
to keep to the sod so as not to go into the brown
soil to their ankles. They crossed the bridge,
waiting there a minute to watch a long freight
train rumble past beneath them. A brakeman,
sitting on a car roof, smoking his pipe, looked
up at them, grinned and waved as he went by.
Then they took the wood path and went down
toward the beach, finding here and there new evidences,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
if any were wanting, of the advent of
Spring.</p>

<p>In the shaded places the snow, rotted and granular,
still lay in little banks fringed with ice.
But tiny green spikes and leaves were pushing
their way through the litter of dead leaves, while,
at the edge of the beach, the grass in one sunny
spot, was actually green. Even the Sound seemed
to look different. The water, reflecting the clear
sky, was as blue as sapphire. The sun shone radiantly
on the few white sails in sight. A steamer,
far out, left a mile-long trail of soft gray smoke
behind it. A bird—Gerald declared joyfully that
it was a robin, but Dan contradicted it—sang
sweetly somewhere behind them in the woods.
Dan began throwing stones into the water from
sheer exuberance of spirit. Then they hurried
back to school, racing half the way, and reached
Oxford just in time for Chapel. Even here the
new influence was apparent; there was an unaccustomed
restlessness in evidence; fellows
scuffled their feet and glanced longingly toward
the big windows which, partly opened, let in the
softly appealing scent of Spring. All that day
fellows lingered about the steps of the buildings
and sighed when recitation time came, and there
was much talk of tennis and baseball and track
work. Two enterprising chaps got a canoe out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
of the boathouse in the afternoon and paddled
up the river.</p>

<p>And a week later Spring industries had really
begun. In the gymnasium the track and field
candidates were going through the preliminary
work, the tennis courts were being rolled and
raked and mended, and in the basement of the
gymnasium, inside the big cage, the baseball candidates
were toiling mightily. Although the outdoor
season for baseball at Yardley never opens
until after Spring recess is over, a full fortnight
of indoor work precedes it. This indoor work is
in charge of the captain, for the coach doesn’t
appear until the candidates get out. This year
there was an unusually large number of entries
for the team, and Captain Millener had his hands
full. Luckily, more than half of last year’s team
remained in school, and from these fellows Millener
obtained assistance.</p>

<p>Stuart Millener was a tall, lanky, black-eyed
First Classman, with a shock of black hair and
enough energy to run half a dozen baseball teams.
Millener had never distinguished himself in his
studies, but he had worked hard at them and had
always managed to remain at peace with the
Faculty. He was a fellow who was now and always
would be better able to work with his hands
than with his brain. And there are plenty of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
places for that sort in the world. As a first-baseman
he was a huge success, and there seemed
no reason why he should not turn out to be an
excellent leader. He was highly popular and fellows
believed in him. The Kingdon Gymnasium
at Yardley is still one of the finest in the country
and its baseball cage is roomy and light. Here
every afternoon from half-past three until after
five the baseball candidates practised. Fifty-seven
fellows reported for work, and they were
divided into three squads and each squad was
given a half-hour’s work. There was five minutes’
hard work with the dumb-bells for all hands as
a starter, and then the pitchers got busy under
Colton’s direction, and Millener and his assistants
looked after the batting and fielding. In
order to leave the cage free for the latter branches
of the art of baseball, the pitchers and catchers
used the bowling alleys upstairs. Fielding practice
was confined to the handling of grounders
and slow hits, but there was plenty of room in the
cage for this work, as well as for throwing and
sliding to bases.</p>

<p>Dan was one of the first candidates to report
and during the two weeks that intervened between
that time and the beginning of Spring recess
he toiled hard and enthusiastically. At
home, on his school team, he had played at second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
base and had never had any trouble in keeping
his place. How he would compare with the other
claimants for infield positions here at Yardley
remained to be seen, but Alf declared that he
was sure to make the nine, if not as a baseman,
at least in the outfield.</p>

<p>Gerald, long since released from probation, had
bothered Mr. Bendix, the Physical Director, until
that autocrat had given Gerald another examination,
had congratulated him on his physical improvement
and had finally grudgingly given him
permission to play class baseball. And Gerald
was mightily pleased. He bought a book of rules
over in Greenburg and read it through from one
blue cover to another, and asked so many questions
that Dan’s head was in a whirl half the time.
When Spring recess began Gerald was without a
doubt the best read youth in school on the subject
of baseball.</p>

<p>Spring recess and the month of April began almost
together. Of the former there was to be
just a week. Gerald’s father, writing from Berlin
a fortnight before, had suggested that the two
boys spend the vacation in New York. Both
Gerald and Dan were delighted at the idea. Had
it not been for this invitation Dan would have had
to spend the recess at school, since it was hardly
practicable to journey out to his home in Ohio<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
for so short a time. He wrote to his father and
received permission to accept Gerald’s hospitality.
And with the permission came something
quite as welcome, a check for ten dollars.</p>

<p>“You’ll want some money to spend,” wrote
Mr. Vinton, “and so I enclose herewith check for
ten dollars. You mustn’t let your friend pay
for everything, you know. Have a good time, and
write and tell us what you do in New York. Your
mother says you are to be very careful about
crossing streets and riding in the subway. I say
the same. The papers are full of accidents to
folks in that town. You must try and get young
Pennimore to come out and visit you this summer.
It won’t do to let him do all the entertaining. If
you think well of this, I will write to Mr. Pennimore
about it when the time comes. Your mother
and sister send their love. Your mother will
write Sunday. Mae says I’m to tell you to send
her lots of postcards from New York, and they
must be colored ones, and you are to write on
them all. My regards to Gerald. Your loving
father.”</p>

<p>“I’d just love to go out and visit you,” said
Gerald, when Dan read that portion of the letter
to him, “but I don’t suppose father will let me.
He will be afraid that the Indians will get me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, the Indians are quite peaceable in Graystone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
now,” laughed Dan. “You just show your
father that you know how to look after yourself,
and I guess he will let you go. Why, a year ago
he wouldn’t have thought of letting you stay in
New York with just the servants, Gerald!”</p>

<p>“That’s so! But he thinks you’re so grand,
Dan; I guess that’s why.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll be just as ‘grand’ next summer,”
replied Dan cheerfully. “I’ll bet he will let you
go. If he does, we can have a dandy time at
home.”</p>

<p>But meanwhile they were looking forward to a
dandy time in New York. And they had it.
When they arrived at the house there was a good
dinner awaiting them, a dinner which Mr. Pennimore’s
chef fashioned for the delectation of two
hungry boys. Strange soups and unpronounceable
entrees and fancy dishes in general were
omitted, and all the time they were there they
had just the sort of things they liked. They were
not, all of them, the things usually prescribed
for schoolboys, however, and if Spring recess had
lasted two weeks instead of one, it is probable
that they would have had to go under the doctor’s
care.</p>

<p>“Gee!” exclaimed Dan on one occasion, “this
cream pie is simply swell, Gerald! I suppose if
I make the baseball team I’ll have to go in training.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
So I’m going to make the most of my
chances now.”</p>

<p>“So am I,” replied Gerald. “There won’t be
much more pie for us after we get back, will
there?”</p>

<p>“Oh, you won’t have to train if you make the
class team,” said Dan. “It’s just the Varsity,
you know.”</p>

<p>“Won’t I?” asked Gerald disappointedly.</p>

<p>“Well, I guess I’ll go in training, anyway. It’s
good for you.”</p>

<p>Those were seven splendid days, and yet when
the last one came neither of the two was sorry.
Theaters and picture galleries and drives and
walks were jolly enough, but, as Gerald sagely
remarked, a fellow soon gets tired of them.</p>

<p>“I’d a heap rather play baseball or tennis than
go to the theater,” said Gerald. “Wouldn’t
you?”</p>

<p>Dan replied that he would, but he said it hesitatingly,
for theaters and such things were more
of a novelty to him than to Gerald. But he was
quite as contented as Gerald when the train set
them down at Wissining again. They went over
to Dudley after dinner and called on Alf and Tom.
Every one talked vacation for a while, and then
the conversation turned to baseball and school
sports.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>“Payson’s coming next Monday,” announced
Alf. “I saw Millener a while ago. He said that
if the ground dries up enough we’ll get out on the
field the first of the week.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s soppy enough now,” said Dan.
“And it looks like rain again.”</p>

<p>“Is Payson the coach?” asked Gerald.</p>

<p>“Yes,” Dan replied. “You remember him last
Fall, don’t you? The chap that coached the
football team?”</p>

<p>“Oh! Does he coach in baseball, too?”</p>

<p>“You bet he does!” said Alf. “And he’s a
dandy, too. He used to catch for Cornell when
he was there, and they say he was the best ever.
By the way, Gerald, Dan says you’re going in for
baseball.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Mr. Bendix said I might. Do you think
I’ll stand any show for the Fourth Class team,
Alf?”</p>

<p>“Ever played much?” Gerald shook his head
sadly.</p>

<p>“I never played at all in a game. But I can
throw a ball pretty well and catch; and I can bat
a little. I had a tutor last year who used to play
with me, and he said I did pretty well.”</p>

<p>“I dare say you’ll do as well as most of
them,” said Tom. “Don’t let them think you’re
a duffer, though; put up a front; tell ’em you’re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
one of the finest young baseball players that ever
struck the Hill.”</p>

<p>“I guess they wouldn’t believe that,” laughed
Gerald. “Don’t you play, Tom?”</p>

<p>“Baseball? I rather guess not! It’s a silly
game.”</p>

<p>Alf laughed maliciously.</p>

<p>“No,” he said, “Tom doesn’t care for baseball,
especially the batting part of it, do you, Tom?”
Tom growled.</p>

<p>“You see,” Alf continued, smiling reminiscently,
“Tom went out for the team last Spring.
They thought he was big enough to be promising
material. So Payson let him stay on a while.
One day, just after we got out of doors, we had
batting practice at the net. Colton was pitching.
You know, he has about everything there is, Colton
has, and he thought he’d have some fun with
Tom. So the first ball he sent Tom swiped at
so hard that he fell over himself and tumbled
into the net.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t either,” laughed Tom.</p>

<p>“That made him mad. So he spit on his hands,
got a good grip on the bat, and tried the next one.
That was an in-shoot, and Tom didn’t know it.
It took him plumb in the ribs. We all laughed
at that, and Tom got madder than ever. ‘Put it
where I can hit it!’ he yelled to Colton. ‘I dare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
you to!’ So Colton did it, but he sent it so fast
that Tom didn’t see it until it was by him.”</p>

<p>“It was over my head,” protested Tom, indignantly.</p>

<p>“Then Colton just let himself loose, and the
rest of us, standing around waiting for our turns,
just laughed ourselves sick! Once Tom lost hold
of his bat, and it went about fifty feet into the
field, just missing Colton by a foot. Another
time Tom reached out so far that he fell on his
face. Then another in-shoot took him in the arm,
and that was enough. Tom threw down the bat
and walked off.</p>

<p>“‘Here, where are you going?’ asked Payson.</p>

<p>“‘Home,’ said Tom. ‘What’s the good of
standing up there and letting him slug me with
the ball? I’ve got a smashed rib and a busted
shoulder, and that’s all I want. I’m no hog!’”</p>

<p>“It makes a good story, the way he tells it,”
said Tom, when the laughter had ceased. “It’s
a fact, though, that he did give me two awful
whacks with that fool ball. Pshaw, I couldn’t
hit it in a thousand years! I knew that, so I got
out. Afterwards I tried to get Colton to stand
up at the net and let me throw a few balls at him,
but he wouldn’t do it. I told him he could have
all the bats he wanted, too, but that didn’t seem
to satisfy him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’ll bet you couldn’t have hit him,” jeered
Alf.</p>

<p>“Couldn’t I? If he’d let me try he’d have
gone to the hospital!”</p>

<p>“But you’re on the Track Team, aren’t you?”
Gerald asked.</p>

<p>“Yes. There’s some sense to that.”</p>

<p>“Tom’s happy if you give him a sixteen-pound
shot or a lump of lead on the end of a wire,” said
Alf. “He won eight points for us last Spring.
But you ought to see the crowd scatter when he
gets swinging the hammer around.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you dry up,” said Tom.</p>

<p>“Fact, though,” laughed Alf. “Once last year
when he was practising, the blamed thing got
away from him and tore off about ten feet of the
grandstand. Andy Ryan said it was a lucky
thing the framework was of iron, or else he’d
have smashed the whole stand up.”</p>

<p>“You fellows are having lots of fun with me,”
growled Tom, good-naturedly, as he arose and
took up his cap, “and I hate to spoil your enjoyment,
but I promised to look up Rand this evening.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” Dan assured him, “we can
have just as much fun with you when you’re not
here.”</p>

<p>“Well, what you don’t know can’t hurt you.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
By the way, Gerald, want to come around to Oxford
with me Saturday night? We’ve got a fellow
coming over from Greenburg after the debate
to do some sleight-of-hand for us.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to,” replied Gerald, “but—” He
glanced anxiously at Dan and Alf.</p>

<p>“Sure,” said Alf. “Go ahead. We’re glad
to have you. The more you see of Oxford, the
better you’ll like Cambridge. You see, Gerald,
the only way they can get the fellows to attend
Oxford is by supplying them with vaudeville entertainments.
In another year or so they’ll have
to have brass bands and free feeds if they want
fellows to go there!”</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” replied Tom. “We know
who won the last debate. I’ll call around for you
Saturday, Gerald, if I don’t see you before.
Good night.”</p>

<p>“We gave it to you!” shouted Alf as the door
closed behind his chum. “Why you haven’t got
a debater in your whole society.” But the challenge
was wasted, and Alf turned to Dan. “We’ll
have to win the debate this Spring,” he grumbled,
“or there won’t be any living with Tom!”</p>

<small>POLITICS AND CHESS</small></h2>

<p>Payson appeared on Monday and took up his
lodgings in the village. But, as events proved,
he might just as well have delayed his arrival for
another week, for on Sunday morning it began to
rain as though it meant to flood the country, and
it continued practically without interruption until
Wednesday night. By that time the river was
over its banks, Meeker’s Marsh was a lake, the
athletic field was like a sponge, and outdoor practice
was impossible. The work in the cage went
on, but the fellows were getting tired of it, and
longed for sod under foot and sky overhead.
Payson didn’t waste that week, by any means,
but, with the first game only a fortnight off, the
enforced confinement to the gymnasium was discouraging.</p>

<p>John Payson was about thirty years of age, and
weighed in the neighborhood of two hundred
pounds. He was large, broad-shouldered, and,
in spite of his weight, alert and quick of movement.
He had played baseball and football in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
college days, first at Cornell, and later, as a
graduate student, at Yale. “Whopper” Payson
was his name in those days, and for two years
he had made the All-America Football team as a
guard. While at Cornell he had caught for two
years on the Varsity Baseball nine, and they still
remember him there as one of the best. During
his five years as coach at Yardley he had helped
at three football and two baseball victories over
Broadwood. It would be an exaggeration to say
that Payson was universally popular at Yardley.
He was a good deal of a martinet, had a quick
temper and a sharp tongue. But he was just in
his dealings with the fellows, was a hard worker,
and as unsparing of himself as of his charges.
The older boys, those who had known him longer,
liked him thoroughly, while the younger fellows,
many of whom blamed him for their inability to
make the teams, called him hard names.</p>

<p>The baseball candidates finally got out of doors
a week later than expected. By this time the
April sky appeared to have emptied itself of rain,
and a warm sun was busy drying up the sodden
land. The fellows felt and acted like colts that
first afternoon. It was bully to feel the springy
turf underfoot, to smell the moist fragrance of
growing things, and to have the west wind capering
about the field. Even a full hour and a half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
of hard work failed to quench their spirits, and
they swarmed into the gymnasium at half-past
five as jolly as larks. The next afternoon practice
ended with a four-inning game between the
first and second teams, and Dan played during
two of the innings in center-field. He had but one
chance and accepted it. At his single appearance
at bat he got to first on fielder’s choice, having
knocked a miserable little hit half way to third
base, and was caught ingloriously in an attempt
to steal second. And yet he could congratulate
himself on having made as good an appearance
as any of the other dozen or so candidates for
fielding positions. By the middle of the week
practice had settled down to hard work, and on
Friday the first cut was made. Some twenty
candidates were dropped from the squad, only
enough being retained to compose two nines and
substitutes. Dan found himself on the second
nine, playing when the opportunity offered at
right or center-field. But he felt far from secure,
for it was well known that a further reduction
of the squad was due some time the following
week.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Gerald had astounded Dan and the
rest of his friends, not yet many in number, by
winning a place on the Fourth Class team. I
think Gerald must have been a natural-born baseball<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
player, if there is such a thing; otherwise he
would never, with his slight experience, have
made the showing he did. Perhaps the standard
of excellence required of a candidate for admission
to the team wasn’t very high, but there were
many fellows amongst those trying for places
who had played ball for two or three years.
Gerald showed unsuspected alertness in handling
the ball, accuracy in throwing, and a good eye at
the bat. And so, a week after the class teams
had begun work, Gerald found himself playing
shortstop on his nine. Naturally, he was in the
seventh heaven of bliss, and talked baseball,
thought baseball, and dreamed baseball. Alf
amused Dan and Tom by claiming some of the
credit. Personally, I think there was reason in
his contention. At all events he made out a good
case.</p>

<p>“Oh, you may laugh,” said Alf earnestly, “but
it’s so. If Gerald hadn’t had those boxing lessons
he wouldn’t have made good. They taught
him to see quick and act quick, and they taught
him accuracy. When you come to think of it,
boxing and baseball aren’t so much unalike. In
boxing you have a fellow’s glove to stop and your
own to get away, and get away quick and accurately.
In baseball you have the ball to stop and
to get away. In either case it’s quickness and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
accuracy of eye and brain and body that does the
trick.”</p>

<p>“Pooh!” scoffed Tom. “If Gerald ever gets
to be President you’ll try to show that it was
because you gave him boxing lessons when he
was a kid.”</p>

<p>But whether or not part of the credit was due
to Alf, it remains a fact that Gerald was about
the proudest and happiest youngster in the whole
school, with only one thing to worry him. That
thing was the fact that devotion to baseball was
playing hob with his lessons. It was Kilts who
first drew his attention to the fact. He asked
him to remain behind the class one morning.</p>

<p>“What’s wrong, lad?” he asked kindly.
Gerald hesitated a moment, trying to find a plausible
excuse. In the end he decided that the truth
would do better than anything else.</p>

<p>“It’s baseball, sir,” he answered frankly. “I’m
on my class team, and—and I guess I haven’t
been studying very hard.”</p>

<p>“Well, well, that won’t do,” said Kilts gravely.
“Baseball is a fine game, I have no doubt, but
you mustn’t let it come between you and your
studies, lad. Better let baseball alone a while,
I’m thinking, until you can do better work than
you’ve been doing the last week. Baseball and
all such sports belong outdoors; they’re well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
enough there; but when you take them into class
with you—” Kilts shook his head soberly—“you’re
brewing trouble. You know I’m right,
don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” Gerald answered. “I’ll try and—and
do better.”</p>

<p>“That’s the lad! Youth must have its pleasures,
but there’s work to do, too. Ye ken what
Bobby Burns said?</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“‘O man! while in thy early years,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">How prodigal of time!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Misspending all thy precious hours,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Thy glorious youthful prime!’<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>“He was no the hard worker himself, was
Bobby,” added Mr. McIntyre with a chuckle,
“but he sensed it right, I’m thinking. Well, run
along, lad, and remember, I’m looking for better
things from you.”</p>

<p>So Gerald ran along, just as the next class began
crowding into the little recitation room, and
when study time came that evening, instead of
leaning over his books with one hand in a fielder’s
glove, as had been his custom of late, he put glove
and ball out of sight behind a pillow on the window
seat before he sat down. Dan saw, and
breathed easier.</p>

<p>The second cut in the Varsity squad came, and
Dan survived it. The first game, a mid-week<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
contest with Greenburg High School, found the
Yardley team somewhat unprepared. Kelsey, a
second string pitcher, was in the box and was
extremely erratic. Greenburg had no difficulty
in connecting with his delivery, and the Yardley
outfield was kept pretty busy during the six innings
which were played before a sharp downpour
of rain sent the teams and spectators
scurrying from the field. Dan didn’t get into the
game, much to his regret, for there were lots of
chances for the outfielders that afternoon. Yardley
managed to pull the game out of the fire in the
fifth inning, and won, 8-6.</p>

<p>So far Dan had not flaunted his ambition to
play on one of the bases. But the following Monday
he found himself sitting on the bench beside
Stuart Millener. Millener was watching the base-running
practice, his place on first being occupied
for the time by a substitute. He asked Dan where
he had played before, and learned that at Graystone
Dan had occupied second base.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Millener, “Danforth is making
pretty good at second, and unless something happens,
he will stay there, I guess. But there’s no
harm in being prepared, Vinton, and I’ll let you
see what you can do there.”</p>

<p>Millener was as good as his word, and when
practice began Dan found himself in Danforth’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
place. Of course, he was rusty, and he and Durfee,
shortstop, failed to work together at first.
But he made no bad plays, and shared in a speedy
double with Millener. At the bat Dan was still
rather weak. After practice Payson called
him.</p>

<p>“You’ve played on second before, Millener
says, and so I’m putting you down for a substitute
baseman, Vinton. You’d rather play there,
wouldn’t you?”</p>

<p>“Much,” answered Dan. “But I’d rather
make good as a fielder than try for a base and
not make it.”</p>

<p>“Well, you see what you can do. I don’t believe
you’ll have much show for second, but you
might possibly make third. Ever play there?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, but I guess I could.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll see. You want to be a little
shiftier on your feet, though, Vinton. You
haven’t got as much time to make up your mind
in the infield as you have in the out.”</p>

<p>Dan told Alf of his promotion while they were
dressing in the gymnasium.</p>

<p>“That’s good,” said Alf. “I guess Payson
means to get you on third. Condit isn’t much;
Lord beat him out for the place last year, and
would have had it this if he’d returned. I guess
Payson thinks he owes you something for pulling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
us out of the hole in the Broadwood game last
Fall.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, I don’t believe I want to get it that
way,” said Dan thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“What way?”</p>

<p>“I mean I don’t want to get it by favor.”</p>

<p>“Piffle! Don’t you worry. If you get it, it’ll
be because you deserve it. Payson may help you,
Dan, but you needn’t worry about having the
place presented to you on a plate. Payson isn’t
that sort. He never lets his liking for a fellow
influence him much. I rather wish he did. He
and I are pretty good friends, and I’d rather like
to play shortstop. But nothing doing.”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t seem exactly fair for me to step
into the infield when you’ve been on the team two
years,” said Dan.</p>

<p>“Pshaw, I was only fooling! I’m happy
enough out in left field. Why, I couldn’t play
short for a minute. I’ve tried it. I can catch
flies and throw to base pretty well, but if it wasn’t
for the fact that I can bat with the next fellow I
wouldn’t hold down my place a minute. I know
some schools where you can have almost anything
in reason if you happen to be football or baseball
captain. But the rule doesn’t work that way
here. Millener couldn’t have made the scrub last
fall, and he knew it, and didn’t try. And I know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
that the only thing that keeps me on the nine is
the fact that I bat better than any one except
Colton. Oh, you have to work for what you get
at Yardley. A good thing, too. Over at Broadwood
they have about half a dozen societies and
society men have the first choice every time. Considering
that, it’s a wonder they do as well as
they do.”</p>

<p>“I should say so,” agreed Dan. “It’s about a
stand-off in athletics, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“It’s run pretty evenly the last ten or twelve
years in baseball and football,” replied Alf, “but
we win three out of four times in track games.
And we’re away ahead in hockey, in spite of this
year’s fizzle. They usually do us up at basket-ball,
though. But who cares about basket-ball,
anyway—except Tom?”</p>

<p>“I should think we’d go in for rowing here,”
said Dan.</p>

<p>“Well, there isn’t a decent course within a
good many miles,” said Alf. “I don’t believe
Yardley ever tried rowing. The year before I
came here they had an ‘Aquatic Tournament,’
whatever that is; Broadwood came over and there
were canoe races and swimming races and diving
stunts on the river. But Broadwood got so everlastingly
walloped that there wasn’t much fun
for any one and it was never tried again.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>A little later, on the way across the Yard, Dan
said:</p>

<p>“By the way, Alf, Cambridge sends out invitations
in about two weeks. I want to get Gerald in,
if I can. How do you feel about it?”</p>

<p>“Me? Why, I’ll help, of course. Gerald’s not
a bad little chap, not by any means. I guess we
can make it go all right. We’ll have to do a
little political work, though. I wonder whether
he’d rather join Cambridge than Oxford. He
and Tom get on pretty well together, you know,
and Tom’s had him up to Oxford twice.”</p>

<p>“I think he will take Cambridge if he gets a
chance,” Dan replied. “I’m going to take him
again Saturday night. I suppose we’d better talk
him up with the fellows.”</p>

<p>“Yes. I guess we’re certain of five or six
votes already. And we can get that many more
without much trouble.”</p>

<p>“Just what is the method of selecting fellows?”
asked Dan, as they came to a pause at the doorway
of Dudley.</p>

<p>“You get a majority of the meeting to agree on
the candidate, first. Then his name is put down
on the list, and the list goes to the Admission
Committee. The Committee is composed of the
President and two members from each class of
the three upper classes, seven in all. They vote<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
on the names as they’re read off. One black ball
keeps a fellow out.”</p>

<p>Dan whistled softly.</p>

<p>“That doesn’t sound so easy,” he said.</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess we won’t have any trouble. I
know most of the Committee. Colton’s president,
you know; he will vote the way I ask him to.
Then there’s Millener and Kapenhysen of the
First Class, both good chaps; and Chambers and
Derrick of the Second. Chambers will vote for
Gerald anyway without asking, and Derrick is a
particular friend of Tom’s, and will do as Tom
says. The Third Class men—blessed if I know
who they are; do you?”</p>

<p>Dan shook his head.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll find out to-morrow,” said Alf.
“Don’t you worry, we’ll get little Geraldine in
all right. By the way, why didn’t you come over
to the gym Saturday morning? We had a lively
little bout, I tell you. I guess it will be the last
for a while, too. Now that practice has begun
neither Gerald nor I seem to have much time for
punching each other’s noses. Well, be good, Dan.
Come around to-night if you can.”</p>

<p>Dan was too busy to call that evening, but the
following night found him and Gerald in Number
7. For some time past Tom had been teaching
Gerald chess, and to-night the board was brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
out and the two were soon deep in the game. Dan
and Alf had been talking baseball, but after
a while Dan interrupted to ask:</p>

<p>“By the way, did you find out about that?”</p>

<p>“About—? Oh!” Alf looked rather queer,
as he drew a slip of paper toward him and
scribbled two names on it. “Yes, I found out
this morning. Here they are.” He pushed the
slip across to Dan. Dan read and returned Alf’s
look with one of frowning surprise.</p>

<p>“Hm,” he said.</p>

<p>“Just so,” returned Alf dryly.</p>

<p>“Do you think—” began Dan. Alf shrugged
his shoulders.</p>

<p>“Blessed if I know. I thought you might.”
He looked hesitatingly over at Gerald’s bowed
head. “Perhaps—?”</p>

<p>Dan nodded.</p>

<p>“I say, Gerald,” said Alf, “I hate to interrupt
that absorbing game of yours, but would you
mind telling me how you and your friend Arthur
Thompson are getting on these days?”</p>

<p>Gerald looked blank for a moment.</p>

<p>“Thompson?” he repeated. “Oh! Why, we
always nod when we meet each other. We’ve
never spoken since the night of the snowball fight.
Why, Alf?”</p>

<p>“I was just wondering,” replied Alf vaguely.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
“I wondered whether you were friends or not.
Does he seem inclined to be decent?”</p>

<p>“We-ell, he hasn’t tried to be smart with me,”
answered Gerald. “But I don’t think he cares
for me much. And I’m pretty sure I don’t like
him.”</p>

<p>“I see. And do you know a fellow named
Hiltz, Jake Hiltz, a Third Class fellow; lives in
Whitson?”</p>

<p>Gerald shook his head.</p>

<p>“I don’t think so. I may know him by sight.
Ought I to know him, Alf?”</p>

<p>“N-no, I guess not. I don’t believe he would
prove much of an addition to your visiting list.”</p>

<p>“Your move, Gerald,” said Tom.</p>

<p>When the players were absorbed again, Alf
said:</p>

<p>“It doesn’t look so easy now, does it?”</p>

<p>Dan shook his head. “No, it looks rather
bad.”</p>

<p>“I think maybe Tom had better work his end,”
suggested Alf. “Know what I mean?”</p>

<p>“Oxford?” asked Dan.</p>

<p>“Yes, we wouldn’t want him to miss them
both, eh? I’ll speak to him about it to-night.
Maybe he means to anyway, he’s taken quite a
shine to—someone.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Dan. “I’m sorry, though.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
I don’t suppose there is anything I could do
with—” He tapped the slip of paper.</p>

<p>“No, he’d probably resent it, as you don’t
know him. Besides, we don’t know that he will
object. It may go through all right. But if I
were you I’d speak to—you know who, and tell
him how it stands. Perhaps he will have a chance
to smooth things over with Thompson.”</p>

<p>“I can’t quite imagine him doing it,” replied
Dan, with a smile. “He’s more likely to punch his
head, if only to make use of what you’ve taught
him.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll see the thing through, anyway,”
answered Alf hopefully. “We’ll get his name
up to the Committee. After that—well, it’s past
us. But if G could make it up with T, I guess
he’d go through all right.”</p>

<p>“He never would, though. Still, I’ll suggest
it to him when we go back.”</p>

<p>“Got you,” said Tom quietly.</p>

<p>“How? Why?” asked Gerald, studying the
board perplexedly. “Why can’t I move—.” He
stopped. Then: “O-oh!” he said expressively.
Dan and Alf laughed.</p>

<p>“Beat you again, did he?” asked Dan. Gerald
nodded, smiling somewhat sheepishly.</p>

<p>“Don’t you care, Gerald,” said Alf. “Tom is
really a pretty neat little chess player. I dare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
say there isn’t more than one fellow in school who
can beat him, and modesty forbids my mentioning
that fellow’s name.” Tom snorted. “Chess is a
fool game, anyway; a game for children and
idiots.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you play?” asked Gerald innocently.</p>

<p>“Play?” answered Alf above the laughter.
“Well, you just ask Tom who wins when we play
together.”</p>

<p>“Yes, ask me,” said Tom dryly. “Checkers is
your game, Alf.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m not saying I can’t do pretty well at
that, too, but when it comes to chess—well, again
my inherent modesty forbids me to pursue the
subject.”</p>

<p>“Huh! You don’t know a king from a pawn,”
jeered Tom.</p>

<p>“That’s a challenge,” replied Alf. “Let me at
him, Gerald. Just you fellows watch if you want
to see pride humbled and a haughty spirit destroyed.
Let me see, Tom, where do I put these
things?”</p>

<p>“I guess we’ll have to be going,” laughed Dan,
“although I can see that it is going to be a rare
battle.”</p>

<p>“Rare?” repeated Alf, with a grin. “Oh, no,
not rare, Dan; I’m going to do him to a turn.
Move, Tom, but be careful how you do it. Remember<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
that I have my argus eye on you. Here!
You can’t do that! Of course you can’t. Did
you see the way he moved, Dan? That’s cheating,
sure! Here, where are you fellows going?”</p>

<p>“Home, before the trouble begins,” answered
Dan. “Come on, Gerald.”</p>

<p>“Trouble! There isn’t going to be any
trouble,” said Alf. “This is going to be the easiest
thing I ever did. But if you must go, see you
to-morrow. Gee, he’s pinched my knight!”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV</a><br />
<small>THE LISTS ARE POSTED</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Back in Clarke, Dan and Gerald spread out
their books on opposite sides of the table for an
hour or more of study. Gerald was keeping his
promise to Mr. McIntyre, and was really doing
the best he was capable of at algebra. But it did
seem as though Fate was against him, for, in
order to do full justice to mathematics, he had to
give less time to his other studies, with the result
that his French had been suffering of late, and
Mr. Von Groll had once or twice showed impatience.
It seemed desperately hard to please
everyone, thought Gerald.</p>

<p>Across the table Dan browsed through his morrow’s
Latin, and then settled down to geometry.
Now and then Gerald interrupted to ask assistance,
and once Dan reached over for the younger
boy’s book and puzzled out a line in Cæsar’s
Gallic War for him. Nine o’clock struck, and
Gerald looked up from his book with a sigh,
glanced hopefully at Dan, found that youth still
absorbed, and, with another sigh, went back to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
work. But ten minutes later Gerald pushed his
book resolutely away, yawned, stretched, and
spoke.</p>

<p>“I wish this universal disarmament they talk
about nowadays had been a fact about 50 B. C.,”
he said regretfully.</p>

<p>“Yes? Why?” asked Dan, looking up.</p>

<p>“There wouldn’t have been any Gallic War,
and I wouldn’t have to read about it.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Dan, “you’d better not let Collins
hear you put the date of the Gallic War as
50.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, it was around there somewhere,”
answered Gerald indifferently. “What’s the
good of being particular about the date of a thing
that took place thousands of years ago? I never
could remember dates, anyway. I guess I’m only
sure about three.”</p>

<p>“And what are those?” asked Dan, closing his
books and piling them in place.</p>

<p>“My birthday, the day they fired on Fort Sumter,
and the date of the Third and Fourth Class
baseball game.”</p>

<p>Dan laughed. “You want to be careful and
not overtax that brain of yours, Gerald,” he said.
Then: “That reminds me,” he said more seriously.
“There’s going to be a good debate Saturday
evening. Want to go along?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, thanks, I’d like to very much.”</p>

<p>“Cambridge and Oxford take fellows from the
Fourth Class in a week or two,” continued Dan.
“Have you made up your mind which you want
to join?”</p>

<p>“Cambridge,” answered Gerald promptly.
“They both seem very nice, but you and Alf are
both in Cambridge, and—and I think I’d rather
go there—that is, if I can. Do you think I can?”</p>

<p>“That’s what I want to talk about,” replied
Dan, pushing back his chair and clasping his
hands behind his head. “You see, the Society
holds a meeting—it’s a week from Friday—and
takes up the names of the fellows in order. If a
majority of the fellows there are in favor of the
chap his name goes to the Admission Committee.
That committee is made up of the President and
two members from each of the three upper classes,
that is, seven members in all. They pass finally
on the candidates for admission, and a candidate
has to get the whole seven votes to receive an invitation.
Understand?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Gerald anxiously.</p>

<p>“Well, we can get you past the meeting all
right, Gerald, and we’re pretty certain of five of
the seven on the Committee, but the other two,
the Third Class members, are rather more difficult.
Neither Alf nor I know them very well.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
One is a chap named Hiltz and the other is this
fellow Thompson.”</p>

<p>“I guess that queers me, then,” said Gerald
mournfully.</p>

<p>“You think Thompson would vote against
you?”</p>

<p>Gerald nodded. “I’m pretty sure he would.”</p>

<p>“But he said awhile ago, didn’t he, that you
and he were quits?”</p>

<p>“Ye-es, but I don’t think he meant it. He
doesn’t like me, I know.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Dan hesitatingly, “Alf suggested—in
fact, I think so, too, that you might sort of
let him understand that you are ready to be
friends. It won’t be necessary to say very much,
I guess; you might just speak to him when you
see him, and then, if you have the chance, get into
conversation with him. It wouldn’t be hard.”</p>

<p>“I’d rather not get into either society than do
that,” declared Gerald vehemently. “And—and
I don’t believe you’d do it yourself, Dan!”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know,” said Dan hesitatingly.
“Maybe you’re right. But I felt that I ought to
let you know how things stand, so you can do as
you like about—making up with Thompson. I
guess this fellow Hiltz hasn’t anything against
you, and so it’s up to Thompson. He can undoubtedly
keep you out of the society if he wants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
to, Gerald. But maybe he won’t; perhaps we’re
crossing our bridge before we come to it.”</p>

<p>Gerald was silent for a moment. Dan could
see that he was greatly disappointed. Finally:</p>

<p>“Well,” he said, “if I can’t get in, I can’t.
But I was hoping—”</p>

<p>“Well, we’re not beaten yet,” said Dan cheerfully.
“Besides, I wouldn’t be surprised if you
got an invitation from Oxford. Of course, we
Cambridge fellows pretend that our society is
better than the other, but there isn’t any particular
difference, you know. Oxford has some dandy
fellows, and you and Tom get on pretty well together,
and—”</p>

<p>“I shan’t join Oxford,” muttered Gerald. “If
I can’t get into Cambridge I don’t want to join
anything.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I wouldn’t say that,” said Dan soothingly.
“You’d have just as good fun in Oxford,
Gerald. And you know some of the fellows there
now, and Tom can introduce you to lots more.”</p>

<p>But Gerald shook his head and refused to compromise,
and all Dan’s arguments failed to shake
his determination to stand or fall by Cambridge.
Nothing more was said about currying favor with
Thompson. After all, Dan scarcely approved of
it himself; it savored too much of what, in school
parlance, was known as “swiping.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>Perhaps it would have been just as well if Dan
had not suggested it to Gerald at all, for the
latter fearing in his pride that Thompson might
think he was trying to ingratiate himself, went
to quite the opposite extreme, and, whereas
hitherto he had responded to Thompson’s careless,
good-natured nods of greeting, he now refused
to notice that youth at all! The first time
this occurred Thompson thought nothing of it.
The second time he scowled and confided to the
fellow he was walking with that “that Pennimore
kid was a stuck-up little chump.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile May came softly in and all Yardley
was out of doors. The field and track team
was preparing for another victory over Broadwood,
golf enthusiasts were holding tournaments
on the slightest provocation, and the baseball
teams, almost a dozen of them in all, were disputing
every foot of the field. Besides the
Varsity nine, there were four Class teams, as
many dormitory teams, and several “scrub”
nines. Yardley would have seemed to a stranger
to be baseball-mad that Spring.</p>

<p>The Varsity had a schedule of eleven games.
Of these, four had been played by the end of the
first week in May, and the Blue had three victories
and one defeat to her credit. The defeat
had come at the hands of Forest Hill School, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
it had been such a drubbing for Yardley that it
quite took the fellows’ breath away. Fourteen to
three was the score. Most of the enemy’s tallies
had been made during a tragic three innings in
which Reid, a substitute pitcher, had occupied the
box. Reid had subsequently steadied down, but
for three innings more Forest Hill had added an
occasional run to her score, and when, at the beginning
of the sixth, Colton had stepped in to the
rescue the game was past recovery. One result
of the game had been to greatly endanger Condit’s
position at third base, and now Dan was
holding down that bag quite as often as the Second
Class boy. It was not, however, until the
contest with St. John’s Academy, which took
place on a Saturday toward the middle of May,
that Dan found himself starting a game at third.</p>

<p>St. John always brought down a strong team,
and Yardley always did her level best to win the
contest, which was looked upon as being a test
of the Yardley team’s ability. A week later St.
John’s would meet Broadwood, and so it was
possible to make a comparison between Blue and
Green. Colton started the game in the box, it
being planned to use him until the game was
safely “on ice.” Then Reid or Kelsey was to
replace him. As it happened, though, neither of
the substitute twirlers got into the game, for St.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
John’s proved to be a hard-hitting lot, and it was
not until the last of the eighth inning that the
Yardley supporters breathed easy. Then a lucky
streak of batting, inaugurated by Captain Millener,
and continued by Left-fielder Loring and
Shortstop Durfee, added three runs to the Blue’s
tally, and the scorebook showed the home team
leading by two runs. But it wouldn’t do to take
risks even then, and so Colton pitched the game
out, managing to blank St. John’s in the half-inning
that remained.</p>

<p>Dan played a good game at third, accepting
three chances and making good each time. He
had three assists and one put-out to his credit
when the game was over, while his batting record,
if not startling, was creditable for a first game.
He made one hit, struck out twice, and reached
first once on four balls and once on fielder’s
choice. There was a good deal of luck mixed up
with this showing, but Dan didn’t worry about
that. Taken altogether, he had made good, and
Payson as much as said so later in the gymnasium.
And Dan was so elated that he actually
forgot to yell when the cold water struck him in
the shower!</p>

<p>On the following Monday the invitations came
out from Cambridge and Oxford. The lists were
posted in Oxford Hall at noon. Cambridge had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
issued twenty-one invitations and Oxford twenty-six.
Gerald Pennimore’s name was on the Oxford
list, but not on the other. The expected had
happened.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI</a><br />
<small>GERALD MAKES A BARGAIN</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Dan ran across Alf in the corridor of Oxford
soon after the lists were posted. Alf made a
grimace of disgust as he leaned against the base
of the plaster Mercury.</p>

<p>“Well, we lose,” he said.</p>

<p>Dan nodded. “Gerald will be disappointed.”</p>

<p>“Still, he’s made Oxford.”</p>

<p>“He says he won’t take it, and I guess he means
it. He’s a stubborn little chump. I suppose
Thompson queered the game.”</p>

<p>“I guess so. I’ll have a talk with Colton and
Rand; they’ll probably have a fair idea what
happened. Does Gerald know yet?”</p>

<p>“Guess not. I haven’t seen him. I think he’s
in the room. Come on over with me: you’re
through, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“Want me to break the news to the bereaved?”
asked Alf, with a grin. “All right, I’ll go along.
We ought to induce him to take Oxford, although
I suppose we might get him in next Fall.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see how. If Thompson voted against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
him to-day he will probably vote against him
then.”</p>

<p>“Gee, Dan, you’ll never make a politician,”
said Alf. “It isn’t absolutely necessary, is it,
that Thompson should be re-elected to the Admission
Committee next year?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I see! Still, I don’t see how we could
prevent it.”</p>

<p>“I don’t say for certain that we could, but
you’re in his class, and I guess if you made up
your mind to keep him out, you could do it. All
you’d have to do would be to find a popular chap
willing to take the place, and run him for all you
are worth. Why not make a bid for it yourself?
You could beat Thompson easily enough. He’s
not especially popular, I guess. Besides, no
one cares a whole lot about getting on the committee,
anyhow. The honor doesn’t amount to
much. Yes, I guess we could cook Thompson’s
goose all right if we set out to. In fact, I rather
like the idea. I don’t like to be beaten, Dan,
and—say, hanged if we don’t get Gerald into
Cambridge in spite of Mr. Thompson! What do
you say? Will you go in for it?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes, I guess so. I suppose it’s fair
enough?”</p>

<p>“Of course it is! Anything’s fair in politics,
you know.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, but really, Alf! Would it be all right
to scheme around that way?”</p>

<p>“Absolutely!” declared Alf with emphasis.
“We want Gerald in Cambridge. There’s no
reason why he shouldn’t be there. So we just go
ahead and get him there. Come on and let’s find
him. Of course, if he’s changed his mind and
decides to take Oxford, all right. If he hasn’t,
and he asks my advice, I’ll tell him to wait until
Fall, and we’ll get him into Cambridge. And
you back me up.”</p>

<p>They found Gerald in his room. A glance at
his face showed Dan and Alf that he had learned
the result of the Admission Committee’s labors,
in spite of the fact that he was striving to look
unconcerned.</p>

<p>“Say, Gerald, I’m awfully sorry about Cambridge,”
said Alf heartily. “It’s a shame. And
I’m afraid you’ll hate us for letting you think you
were going to make it.”</p>

<p>“Of course I won’t,” replied Gerald soberly.
“You fellows did all you could, and I’m much
obliged. It isn’t your fault. It was Thompson
that did it.” Gerald’s face darkened. “And
I’m going to—” He stopped.</p>

<p>“Going to what?” asked Dan suspiciously.
Gerald turned a rebellious countenance toward
him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’m going to tell him what I think of him!
That’s what!”</p>

<p>“Come now, look here, Gerald,” exclaimed
Dan. “You can’t do that, you know! You don’t
know for certain that Thompson blackballed you.
And even if you did know, you wouldn’t have any
right to call him to account for it. Any member
of that committee has a right to vote as he likes,
and—”</p>

<p>“I’m going to punch his head, just the same,”
said Gerald doggedly.</p>

<p>“No, Dan’s right,” said Alf soothingly. “You
can’t do that, Gerald. At any rate, you can’t
fight him on that pretense. Of course, if you
happened to meet him and didn’t like the way
he wore his hair, or the color of his eyes, and
said so—”</p>

<p>“Cut it out, Alf,” said Dan. “There’s no reason
for scrapping and you know it. Besides,
Gerald can go into Oxford—”</p>

<p>“I’ve told you half a dozen times,” interrupted
Gerald warmly, “that I don’t want Oxford.”</p>

<p>“Sure?” asked Alf eagerly.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m sure,” answered Gerald.</p>

<p>“All right. You stick to that, my boy, and
we’ll have you in Cambridge next Fall as sure as
shooting.”</p>

<p>Gerald viewed him doubtfully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>“Do you mean it, Alf?” he asked. “You’re
not just saying that to—to make me feel better?”</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it,” replied Alf gayly. “Dan and
I have got the whole thing planned. We thought
that if you wanted to go in for Oxford we
wouldn’t say anything about it; just let you go.
But if you don’t, why, don’t even think of it. The
next election is in November, and we’ll get you
through with flying colors. You’ll only be in the
Third then, and will have three years before you.
You really aren’t missing much, you see; lots of
fellows don’t make a society until they’re in the
Third.”</p>

<p>“That’s mighty nice of you,” said Gerald
gratefully. “I don’t care so much now. Only—about
Oxford; do you think Tom will mind if I
don’t take it?”</p>

<p>“Not a bit,” said Dan.</p>

<p>“That’s right,” Alf agreed. “He knew you
preferred Cambridge, and only got you through
there in case you missed it with us, and wanted
consolation. Tom understands perfectly.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll write and decline it,” said Gerald
cheerfully. “What shall I say?”</p>

<p>“Oh, most anything,” said Alf. “Just tell
them to be blowed; tell ’em you’re sort of particular
about whom you associate with, and that—”</p>

<p>“Shut up,” laughed Dan. “Just say that ‘Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
Pennimore declines with thanks the kind invitation
of Oxford Society.’ That’s all that’s necessary,
isn’t it, Alf?”</p>

<p>“Ye-es, I suppose so. But you might add in
a postscript that you hope they’ll choke.”</p>

<p>Thus Gerald’s disappointment was mitigated
by the promise held out by Alf, and the note declining
the invitation to Oxford was despatched
without regrets. Even had Gerald been inclined
to feel sore over his failure he would not have
had much time to indulge his feelings. The inter-class
baseball games were approaching, and practice
demanded much of his time. Gerald was
winning friends now, for his fellow members of
the Fourth Class nine had to admire his playing,
if nothing else. But as they got to know him
better they found other things to like. They soon
discovered that his reserve, which looked so much
like arrogance, was only a cloak to hide a sort of
shyness that was the result of his earlier experiences
at Yardley. They found that he wasn’t
stuck-up—a heinous sin at Yardley—and that he
never referred to wealth or influence. He was
“Pennimore” now; in some cases “Gerald”; the
nicknames, “Miss Nancy,” or “Moneybags,”
seemed to have fallen into disuse.</p>

<p>Gerald thrived and grew happier every day.
He stopped thinking about Thompson, and paid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
no heed to that youth when he met him. And
gradually, but perceptibly, he was undergoing a
physical transformation. His work in the gymnasium
under the careful supervision of Mr.
Bendix, and now his daily exercise on ball-field
and tennis court had not failed of effect. He had
taken on flesh, his color was good, his muscles had
hardened and developed, and his shoulders and
chest had broadened and deepened. And with his
physical betterment came an increased capacity
for study. He found that after an hour’s baseball
practice, followed by a shower and a brisk
rubdown, he was ready to tackle cheerfully the
hardest task in algebra that Mr. Wentworth could
invent. I don’t mean that his marks were all
A’s and B’s. On the contrary, he exhibited a
seeming preference for C’s, with an occasional
B by way of variety. But he was doing good
work, for all of that, and Kilts was pretty well
satisfied. His other studies, English, French, and
Latin, were going better, too, and he was no
longer worrying about his chances of passing the
finals in June. He felt pretty sure of B’s in
English and Latin, and believed he could get C’s
in the other two studies.</p>

<p>The boxing lessons, which had been transferred
from Saturday afternoons to Saturday mornings,
when Alf’s baseball work had claimed the former<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
hours, had now ceased altogether. Alf declared
that Gerald had already learned almost all he
could teach him, and that further development
and improvement depended on himself.</p>

<p>“Go up against the punching-bag, Gerald, two
or three times a week, and keep your muscles
limbered up. Next Fall we’ll go at it again. It’s
bully exercise and it’s bully fun; and it’s a
mighty good thing to know something about boxing.
Maybe you’ll never need the knowledge, and
maybe you will. There’s no harm in having it,
anyway.”</p>

<p>The discontinuance of the boxing lessons left
Gerald his Saturday mornings for other pursuits,
and he chose to devote them to tennis. He had
played tennis a good deal ever since he had been
large enough to swing a racket. Sometimes his
father had been his opponent, sometimes the tutor.
For his age Gerald was a good player, and
was extremely fond of the game. There were
six courts at Yardley, and it was almost always
possible to secure one at some time during the
morning. There was a rule, and a necessary one
it was in view of the large number of fellows who
played, that if others were waiting to use a court,
only three sets could be played at a time. As a
general thing, Gerald’s opponent was Harry Merrow.
Harry was only twelve years of age, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
he played good tennis and was a spirited, hard-fighting
youngster. Gerald usually won, but
Harry always proved a worthy foe.</p>

<p>On a morning in the last week of May, the two
were sitting on the grass beside one of the courts,
waiting for their turn. They had skimped their
breakfasts in order to be early at the courts, but
they found that others had been even more enterprising,
and all the courts were in use. But it
was still far short of nine o’clock, and they had
plenty of time before them. Besides, it wasn’t
bad fun lolling here on the grass in the warm
morning sunlight, and there was plenty to see.
On the court which they had elected to wait for,
two First Class fellows, “top-notchers” both of
them, and members of the Tennis Club, were putting
up an exhibition well worth watching. Beyond,
on the river, several canoes were in sight,
their brightly-colored sides reflected gayly in the
quiet water. The canoes put an idea into young
Merrow’s head.</p>

<p>“I say, Gerald,” he asked, “can you swim?”</p>

<p>“Of course,” was the answer. It seemed to
Gerald that Harry might as well have asked him
if he could breathe. All his summers had been
spent at Sound View, and looking back he could
scarcely remember a time when he hadn’t been
able to swim.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, can you paddle?” was Harry’s next
question.</p>

<p>“Paddle? Oh, you mean in a canoe? No, I
guess not. I never was in a canoe. It doesn’t
look hard, though.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t—very,” answered Harry. “It’s lots
of fun, though. I was wondering why you and I
couldn’t have a canoe, Gerald.”</p>

<p>“That would be dandy!” cried Gerald.
“Could we?”</p>

<p>“Yes, we could rent one. It only costs three
dollars a month. You have to be able to swim,
though, or Faculty won’t let you have one. What
I thought was that—”</p>

<p>“What?” asked Gerald, as the younger boy
hesitated.</p>

<p>“Well, you see, I haven’t much money. I
thought perhaps you’d be willing to pay the three
dollars if I’d show you how to paddle.”</p>

<p>“Of course I will,” said Gerald. “That’s fair
enough. I’d like mighty well to know how. Can
we get a canoe at the boathouse?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Let’s go down after we finish tennis
and see what they’ve got. Shall we?”</p>

<p>Gerald at once agreed, and for a while they
talked canoeing and boating, Harry narrating
some of the good times he had had at home on the
river. Gerald, not wanting to be quite outdone,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
mentioned his ability to row a boat, and then,
led on by Harry, described life on his father’s
big steam yacht, which Harry had often seen
lying at its moorings off Sound View.</p>

<p>Then the talk worked around to baseball, as it
was almost certain to do sooner or later at this
time of the year, and Gerald exhibited with pride
the callousness of his hand and showed the little
finger that had been “mighty near broken, I tell
you!” Harry had tried for a place on the Merle
Hall team, but had failed. However, he had been
made official scorer, and that had brought consolation.
It was evident that in Harry’s estimation
that position qualified him as a critic, for
he pretended to know just what was the matter
with every member of his own team and the
Varsity, and would tell you on the slightest
provocation.</p>

<p>“I tell you, Gerald, Dan Vinton played a great
game at third the other day. He’s going to make
a fine player when he’s had more experience. I
should think you’d be mighty proud to be rooming
with him.”</p>

<p>It had never occurred to Gerald to be proud of
the fact, and he considered it a moment before
replying. Then:</p>

<p>“I’d rather room with him than any fellow
I know,” he replied with conviction. “He—he’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
been mighty good to me ever since I knew
him. You know he—he saved my life last
Fall.”</p>

<p>“Yes, we heard about it, but I never knew just
how it was.”</p>

<p>So Gerald recounted the adventure of the burning
playhouse, and Dan’s rescue, and Harry
listened with round eyes.</p>

<p>“Say, though, you were a chump to go in after
the dog,” he said, when Gerald had finished.
“You might have been all burned up!”</p>

<p>“Well,” answered Gerald simply, “I couldn’t
let Jack burn. He’s the best dog in the world,
Jack is.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to know Vinton,” said Harry, after
a moment’s silence, during which they watched
the tennis battle. “You might ask me up to your
room some night, Gerald.”</p>

<p>“Come whenever you like,” said Gerald. “I
didn’t suppose you needed an invitation.”</p>

<p>“Well, Vinton might not like a kid like me
bothering around him. He was awfully decent
to me once, though. He and I came up from the
station together after Christmas vacation, and I
guess he saw that I was feeling sort of—of homesick.
And he told me to come around that evening
and see him if I was lonesome.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t you go?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>“N-no. I wanted to, but—I didn’t like to. I
was afraid he’d think I was a baby.”</p>

<p>“Dan wouldn’t,” said Gerald. “He understands.
He told me once that when he came here
last Fall he was so homesick that he came near
running away home.”</p>

<p>“Really!” exclaimed Harry. “Think of a fellow
like Dan Vinton being homesick! I wish I’d
known that. I’d have gone and seen him that
time. But I’m going to come around some evening,
if you think he won’t mind.”</p>

<p>“Of course he won’t,” said Gerald scornfully.
“He—he isn’t that sort. Come on; they’re
through. I’ll toss. Rough or smooth?”</p>

<p>After they had played their allowance of three
sets, Gerald winning 6&ndash;3, 6&ndash;4, 7&ndash;5, they went down
to the boathouse and rented a bright green canvas
canoe for the period of one month, and Gerald
had his first lesson in paddling.</p>

<p>It wasn’t long before Gerald reached the conclusion
that Harry had made a very smart bargain,
for paddling isn’t a thing that can be successfully
taught; a fellow must pick it up himself.
Gerald’s instructions consisted principally of
the advice: “Now just do as I do, Gerald;
see?”</p>

<p>And Gerald, occupying a most uncomfortable
and cramped position at the stern of the canoe,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
did as Harry did till his arms ached. Harry insisted
on staying close to shore.</p>

<p>“Faculty raises an awful rumpus,” he explained,
“if you upset. Two Fourth Class fellows
went over last Fall, and Collins wouldn’t let
them go out again.”</p>

<p>Gerald tried to emulate the example of Harry,
but wasn’t very successful that day. Harry’s
work with the paddle was clean and graceful,
while Gerald had difficulty in refraining from
using his blade like an oar. Once, in shifting
his position a little, he caused the canoe to rock.
Harry almost dropped his paddle as he looked
around in alarm.</p>

<p>“Here!” he cried. “What are you trying to
do? Upset us?”</p>

<p>“No, I was just trying to get comfortable,” answered
Gerald.</p>

<p>“Well, you want to be awfully careful in a
canoe. It’s mighty easy to upset.”</p>

<p>“What of it?” asked Gerald, with a laugh.
“I’d rather like a dip. Besides, we could almost
wade ashore from here.”</p>

<p>“No, we couldn’t. This river’s awfully deep,
even right along shore. I—I won’t go out with
you if you’re not careful. The water’s too cold
for a bath.”</p>

<p>“All right,” Gerald agreed. “I’ll be careful.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
Let’s go back now, though; my arms ache like
anything.”</p>

<p>After that scarcely a day went by without seeing
Gerald and Harry on the river, and by degrees
the former got so that he could paddle very
well indeed. One day they accepted a challenge
of two Third Class fellows, and raced them from
Flat Island to the boathouse, a distance of nearly
an eighth of a mile, and beat them handily. But
usually their canoeing took place before recitations
in the morning, or after dinner, when each
had an hour of freedom, for Gerald’s afternoons
were pretty well occupied.</p>

<p>The Fourth Class team had played three games
with outside nines, and although they had lost
two of them, the experience had done them good,
and developed team-play. The third contest, that
with Greenburg Grammar School, they had won
in the last inning by a single tally. The inter-class
series was due the first week in June, and
already fellows had begun to wear their class
colors and speculate as to the outcome. It was
generally conceded that Second would win the
championship but the real interest lay in the
game between Third and Fourth. Third had, as
usual, the advantage of age and experience, but,
again as usual, it was Fourth who made the
greater preparation, who practised most, and who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
excelled in enthusiasm. Nowadays little was
talked of save baseball, although for a few days
preceding the dual track and field meeting with
Broadwood, the runners and jumpers and weight
men claimed some attention.</p>

<p>The meet was at Broadwood, and Yardley’s
team went over well supported. The track meet
was the one athletic event of the school year
which could be absolutely depended on to add to
the Blue’s laurels, and this year’s contest was no
exception. Yardley won decisively, 89 to 54.
Tom did himself proud, winning two firsts and a
fourth, or 11 points in all, and establishing a new
dual record for the 16-pound shot of 41 feet 4
inches. First place in the hammer throw also
went to him, while the broad jump, which he entered
to fill the card, netted him one point. Tom
was the hero of the day, and Yardley journeyed
home happy and triumphant.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s certainly a cinch to get out a paper
during the baseball season,” laughed Alf, as he
turned the leaves of the <cite>Yardley Scholiast</cite>, the
weekly paper published by the students. The
<cite>Scholiast</cite> was playfully referred to as “the
School weakly,” but it was in reality a very good
example of its kind of journalism. “Look here,”
continued Alf, holding up the sheet. “Here’s
three pages of baseball; the two Varsity games
and six miscellaneous, every last one of them in
full detail. That’s an easy way to fill a paper,”
he declared in disgust.</p>

<p>“And the rest of the paper all advertising, I
suppose,” said Tom, who was stretched out along
the window seat, with one foot on the sill.</p>

<p>“Pretty near. Here’s a highly-colored account
of the Track Meet, with a whole lot of slush about
you, and an editorial about the circus.”</p>

<p>“An editorial about the circus?” asked Dan in
surprise. “What’s that for?”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s a regular feature at this time of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
the year. I think they keep it set up and run it
every Spring. About four years ago, I guess,
anyway, before I got here, the fellows went to the
circus over in Greenburg, and rough-housed the
show so that they had to clear the tent. Faculty
didn’t approve and for a couple of years we
weren’t allowed to go to circuses.”</p>

<p>“Is the circus coming here?” asked Gerald.</p>

<p>“Yep, two weeks from Friday. Going?”</p>

<p>“You bet!” replied Gerald. “I love circuses,
don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Crazy about them,” answered Alf cheerfully.
“We’ll all go and feed peanuts to the elephant.”</p>

<p>“I’d rather eat them,” murmured Tom.</p>

<p>“The elephants?” asked Dan.</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” said Alf quickly, “that would be
cannibalism!”</p>

<p>But Tom paid no heed to the insult. He was
smiling broadly at his thoughts. “Say, Alf,” he
asked, “do you remember that write-up of the
Bridgeport football game? Talking about the
<cite>Scholiast</cite> and the games in detail reminded me of
it.”</p>

<p>“Do I!” asked Alf, laughing. “I’ll never forget
it.” He turned to Dan and Gerald. “It was
my first year here. There was a chap named
Bridges, a Second Class fellow, who got on the
<cite>Scholiast</cite> as reported. He was a queer duck, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
Bridges. The editor then was Ames Bradley,
and Brad and I had known each other at prep.
Well, one day we played Bridgeport, and Brad
thought it would be a good chance for Bridges to
show what he could do. So he told him to go and
write up the game, and be sure to give all the
details. Well, I wish you could have seen the
report he handed in! It was the funniest thing
you ever—Say, I wonder if I ever threw that
away, Tom. I begged Brad for it, and he gave it
to me, and I had it kicking around my desk for a
long time. I’ll look and see if it’s there.”</p>

<p>Alf rummaged through several drawers and
finally found what he was after, half a dozen
pages of foolscap pinned together at the corner.
Alf gave a chuckle and settled himself in his chair
again.</p>

<p>“Here it is. Let me read some of it to you.
It turned out afterwards, by the way, that Bridges
had never watched a game of football through
in his life and didn’t know anything about it.
Now, let’s see.”</p>

<p>“‘Yardley vs. Bridgeport. On Tuesday last
our football players played a game on the School
gridiron against the players of Bridgeport and
won. The weather was inclement and threatened
to snow as the two bands of determined players
took up their several positions about the field of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
play. It was a battle royal from first to last and
our players deserve great credit for the manner
in which they outplayed the Bridgeport players.
The audience—’ Hum, never mind that. Here we
are. Now listen to this and bust into tears!
‘The details of the game follow. At the commencement
a Bridgeport player placed the ball
in the middle of the field and retiring for a few
yards ran forward and kicked the ball toward
our players. One of the latter nimbly caught
the ball and proceeded to run with it toward the
goal. At this point it was evidenced that the
Bridgeport players were determined to stop at
nothing in order to win, for almost half of them
threw themselves against our player and bore
him to earth with a shock that could be plainly
heard on the stands. Luckily, however, the
plucky Yardley man was not injured and was
soon on his feet again. The Bridgeport players
had by this time clustered so closely about him
that he saw that further running was impossible.
So he yielded the ball to another of his side and
the opposing players drew up into what is called
a scrimmage. The ball was placed on the ground
and one of our players, uttering signals designed
to confuse the enemy, thrust the ball into the
hands of one of our best players, who, although
small, is very fleet of foot. His name is Worrell,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
and he is one of our four speedy quarter-backs.
Worrell seemed at first in doubt which way to run
and by the time he had made up his mind the
opposing players had seized him in their arms
and borne him to the ground. As the Yardley
team had not gained any advantage they were
allowed to try again. This time the ball was
given to another player whose identity was not
clear to the scribe. This player, trusting to force
rather than elusiveness, jumped into the fray
with the ball in his arms and the rest of our
team, quickly grasping the situation, pushed him
for quite some distance, the Bridgeport players
doing their level best to frustrate the endeavor.
This maneuver succeeded so well that it was tried
many more times, the different players of our
team taking turns at carrying the ball. When
about three-quarters of the field had been so conquered
and the goal of our desire was near, the
Umpire’s keen vision detected an infringement
of the rules of play and he took the ball away
from our players and handed it to Bridgeport.
Some members of the audience expressed displeasure
at this seemingly high-handed exercise
of authority and hooted. But the consensus of
opinion amongst those with whom the scribe discussed
the episode is that the Umpire was quite
within his rights. The Yardley players bore up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
bravely in the face of this keen disappointment
and stood nobly shoulder to shoulder while
Bridgeport strove to take the ball back the way
it had come. Time and again—’ Oh, pshaw, that’s
enough! But isn’t it great?”</p>

<p>“That was surely going some!” laughed Dan.
“I suppose it didn’t get into the paper, did it?”</p>

<p>“Hardly,” answered Alf. “I begged Brad to
run it as a joke, but he wouldn’t. That was
Bridge’s first and last assignment on the <cite>Scholiast</cite>.”</p>

<p>“But the funniest part’s to come,” said Tom,
sitting up, and Alf nodded gleefully. “After that
Bridges was out at every game and the next year
he went out for his Class Team and made it as—as
‘one of the four quarter-backs’; only they
called him right half!”</p>

<p>“I’ve often wondered what became of him after
he left here,” said Alf. “I wouldn’t be surprised
if he was playing good football somewhere.”</p>

<p>“I suppose the fellows teased him a lot about
his story,” said Gerald. But Alf shook his head.</p>

<p>“No, Brad was a mighty decent sort. He
never told anyone except me and I never showed
that around much; just to a few fellows who
promised to keep it dark.”</p>

<p>“He wasn’t a bad sort, Bridges,” said Tom
lazily. “Someone tell me the time.” And when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
Gerald had obeyed, “Gosh!” cried Tom. “I’ve
got a recitation in one minute and a quarter.
Where’s my Anabasis? Throw it over, Dan; it’s
under your elbow. Anybody coming my way?
So long, then.”</p>

<p>“Hold on, you idiot,” said Alf. “I’m coming.
See you at practice, Dan.” And he and
Tom hurried out and clattered down the stairs
of Clarke three steps at a time. Dan seized his
water pitcher, leaned out a window, and sprinkled
them as they ran by on their way to Oxford.
There were howls from below, and shaken fists,
but Dan and Gerald only laughed.</p>

<p>“Got Tom in great shape,” said Dan as he returned
the pitcher to its place. “He won’t find
his Greek as dry as usual to-day.”</p>

<p>Two days later Yardley played Porter Institute
on the diamond and Dan started the game
at third base. He and Condit, a Second Class
boy, were having a hard fight for the position.
Most of the other places on the Varsity were
pretty well settled, but third base was a bone of
contention and the whole school was watching
with interest Dan’s struggle to oust Condit. Dan
himself was not satisfied with the game he was
putting up. Somehow, he didn’t seem as sure of
himself on third as he did on second, and whenever
he found himself there he was handicapped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
by the ever constant fear that he would fail at
some critical moment. And in the Porter game
his fear was verified.</p>

<p>It was the sixth inning, the score was five to
three in favor of Yardley, and Porter had a man
on first and a man on second. Porter was enjoying
a batting rally and using Reid rather
rudely. There was only one out and a hit meant
two runs in all probability. The fourth man up
chose a ball to his liking and sliced it down the
first-base line. Millener, playing off base, made
a wild scramble for it, but it sped by him, just inside
the white mark, and went bounding into right
field. The runners sped for home. Lawrence,
right-fielder, was not asleep, however, and had
raced in as soon as the ball was hit, and now he
managed to smother it some fifteen yards back of
first, recovered quickly, and threw to the plate.
Richards, the catcher, got it nicely, but was too
late to put out the first runner. Quick as a flash
he threw to third. Dan was not napping, but in
some unaccountable manner the ball went through
him, the man from first raced by and sped home
and the score was tied. And Porter had a man
on second and only one out.</p>

<p>The expected had happened to Dan and he could
guess the delight in the heart of Condit over there
on the bench. But he settled down when Alf’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
voice reached him encouragingly from left-field:</p>

<p>“Hard luck, Dan! Never mind! Keep after
’em!”</p>

<p>Reid, too, settled down and disposed of the
next two batters and the teams changed places.
Dan walked back to the bench with a grave face.
But no one, not even Payson, the coach, made any
allusion to his mishap, and, much to his surprise,
he was allowed to finish the game at third. Yardley
took the lead again in the eighth, was tied in
the ninth, and lost the game finally in the eleventh
inning, 8 to 7.</p>

<p>That game decided the contest for third-base.
Condit stepped into first place again and Dan
had to be satisfied with a seat on the bench with
the other substitutes. He was keenly disappointed
and rather inclined to wish that he had
been content with a place in the outfield, where,
at least, he would have been a regular instead of
a mere sub. But Alf insisted that there was still
a chance.</p>

<p>“Condit isn’t any great shakes,” he declared.
“The same thing’s likely to happen to him any
day. Just you keep on edge and make the most of
your opportunities and it’s a safe bet you’ll play
as much of the Broadwood game as he does. And
another thing, Dan; do your level best at the bat.
If you can show yourself a little better there than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
he is it may decide Payson in your favor. Why,
he knows that accidents are likely to happen to
the best fellows. Just you peg away at it, old
chap!”</p>

<p>So Dan pegged away and worked hard at the
batting net and made the most of his chances in
the practice games. And all the time he was
watching Condit as a cat watches a mouse, hoping
uncharitably enough that that youth would
make a costly fumble or go stale. But Condit
kept himself up to the mark and June wore along
and the baseball schedule was nearing its end.</p>

<p>In the first week of June the Class Championship
was decided. There were three consecutive
afternoons when Yardley flamed forth in Class
colors and baseball was the sole subject of conversation.
On the first day the Fourth and
Third Classes clashed on the Varsity diamond
and the respective colors, brown and green, waved
wildly. The whole school turned out to watch
and cheer, the First Class fellows joining forces
with the Third, and the Second with the Fourth.
Even the Faculty attended, their coats decorated
with ribbons of brown and green and blue and
red to prove that they were incapable of favoritism.</p>

<p>I think that perhaps the scorers worked harder
that day than any of the players, for it was a game<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
of runs and errors, and it lasted until the umpire,
Captain Millener of the Varsity, was forced
to call it at the end of the eighth inning. Gerald
played shortstop and did well. To be sure he
made two errors, but then almost every other
player made as many or more. And there weren’t
many who did as well at the bat as he did. He
got three hits, one a two-bagger, and scored two
of the twelve runs which won the day for his
side. Yes, Gerald did bravely, and Dan and Alf
and Tom were proud of him, and told him so,
and Gerald’s head swam with pride and delight.
The final score was 12 to 9, and the Fourth Class
marched off the field bearing their warriors on
high and chanting pæans of victory.</p>

<p>The next day the Second Class Nine did what
was expected of it and drubbed the First heartily.
That contest didn’t occasion as much enthusiasm
as the preceding one or the one which followed.
The third day’s game was almost certain to go
to the Second Class, but the Fourth Classmen refused
to concede it and kept their enthusiasm on
tap every instant. Nor, as it turned out, was the
Fourth so greatly mistaken in their estimate of
their team’s chances. For although the Second
finally won by a safe margin, there were moments
when a victory for the wearers of the brown ribbons
and the wavers of the brown flags seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
not unlikely. Gerald again covered himself with
glory, taking part in a double play that retired the
opposing side just when it seemed about to run
away with the game. And again he batted well,
and if he didn’t score any runs himself he helped
two others to do so. And although vanquished
at last, 10 to 6, the Fourth Class went off the field
cheering and quite well pleased with itself.</p>

<p>One morning a day or two after the final Class
game Gerald met Payson, the coach, on the steps
of the gymnasium. Payson nodded, as he always
did when he met one of the fellows, whether he
knew him personally or not, passed, and then
turned back.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you Pennimore?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” answered Gerald.</p>

<p>“You played shortstop for Fourth Class, eh?
Well, you’ll make a pretty fair player if you keep
on, Pennimore. Next Spring you come and see
me and perhaps we’ll find room for you somewhere
on the squad. How old are you now?”</p>

<p>“Fourteen, sir.”</p>

<p>“Hm; well, get some more flesh and muscle, my
boy, and you’ll do. By the way, I see that your
father has been pretty busy.”</p>

<p>“Sir?”</p>

<p>“Oh, you haven’t seen the morning paper, I
guess.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, sir, I don’t read the papers much.”</p>

<p>“Well, you get to-day’s and you’ll find something
that ought to interest you. I’m sure it
would me if I were in your place,” laughed Payson.
“Don’t forget to report to me next Spring.”</p>

<p>With a smile and a nod he passed on, leaving
Gerald consumed with curiosity. He hurried
over to Oxford and sought the library, but the
morning papers had not yet been placed on file.
But there still remained a quarter of an hour before
his next recitation, and so he went on down to
the station and bought a <cite>New York Herald</cite>. A
glance at the first page explained Payson’s meaning.
One of the columns was headed:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>Then followed a lengthy despatch from London
containing an interview with Mr. Pennimore.
But Gerald was disappointed. His father was always
doing something of this sort and Gerald
didn’t find anything very interesting about it.
He read the article through, just as he would
have read anything concerning his father, and
then thrust the paper into his pocket. The only
feature of the despatch that interested him was
the announcement that Mr. Pennimore would sail
that day from Southampton, a fact which Gerald
already knew.</p>

<p>But if the news didn’t excite Gerald, he found
that there were others who were not so indifferent.
Mr. Collins stopped him in the Yard after dinner
and discussed it at some length.</p>

<p>“A wonderful man, your father, Gerald. You
must be very proud of him.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” replied Gerald.</p>

<p>“Well, you don’t seem very enthusiastic,” said
Mr. Collins with a smile.</p>

<p>“No, sir—that is—well, you see, sir, father’s
always doing something of this sort. I guess it’s
very clever, sir, but I don’t think I’m proud of
him on that account.”</p>

<p>“Then why?” asked the Assistant Principal to
draw him out.</p>

<p>“I don’t quite know,” answered Gerald diffidently.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
“I—I guess because he’s kind and good,
sir. You see, he’s a pretty nice father, Mr. Collins.”
And Gerald looked up smiling a little
and blushing a little. Mr. Collins returned the
smile.</p>

<p>“That’s so, Pennimore. And you’re right.
It’s the man himself and not his success that one
should admire. But big things always enthuse
me, and this last achievement of your father’s is
a big thing, a great big thing. We little fellows
who sit at home and count our fingers have to
admire the big men who get out in the world and
do things.”</p>

<p>Gerald shook his head soberly.</p>

<p>“I don’t think you’re one of the ‘little fellows,’
sir,” he said. Mr. Collins laughed.</p>

<p>“I’m only a big toad in a little puddle, Pennimore.
Your father is a big toad in a big puddle;
that’s the difference. Well, and how are you getting
on nowadays?”</p>

<p>“Pretty well, sir, thank you,” answered Gerald.</p>

<p>“That’s good. Come and see me if you strike
a snag at any time.” And Mr. Collins went on.</p>

<p>The fellows, too, had heard of the Steamship
King’s latest exploit and they let Gerald know
it. But, whereas four months ago they might
have said things that would have hurt Gerald’s
feelings, to-day their allusions were all good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
humored. Millener came across Gerald watching
baseball practice.</p>

<p>“Say, Pennimore,” he said gravely, “I wish
you’d ask your father when you see him if he
hasn’t got a steamship he doesn’t need. Just a
small one will do, say eight or ten thousand tons.”</p>

<p>And Gerald laughed and promised.</p>

<p>Mr. Pennimore had written Gerald that he
would be home nine days after the latter’s receipt
of the letter; that he had sent orders for the opening
of Sound View for the summer and that Gerald
should move over there from the school dormitory
as soon as he liked. Gerald was delighted
at the prospect of seeing his father again, but
the permission, which virtually amounted to a
suggestion, to change his abode from Number 28
Clarke to the big room in the big house overlooking
the Sound didn’t please him at all.</p>

<p>“I don’t want to live at home, Dan,” he exclaimed.
“Why, that’s no fun at all! I—I want
to stay here with you; and the other fellows,” he
added as an afterthought.</p>

<p>“Well, you wait until your father comes and
tell him about it,” counselled Dan. “It will only
be for a couple of weeks, anyway, and I guess he
won’t mind that.”</p>

<p>“Anyhow,” declared Gerald anxiously, “I just
won’t go!”</p>

<span class="i0">“The Monkey he’s a friend of mine,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">In fact, I’ve heard it stated<br /></span>
<span class="i1">That me and he and he and me<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>Thus sang Alf as, arm in arm with Tom, he
swaggered across the bridge on the way to Greenburg
and the circus. Behind walked Dan and
Gerald and Paul Rand. Still further behind
came more of Yardley, and further ahead were
others. Yardley was turning out <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en masse</i> for
the circus. Cuts had been granted in all afternoon
recitations and here was a half-holiday with
nothing to do but have a good time! And every
fellow was determined to have it.</p>

<p>“Next verse!” shouted Dan.</p>

<p>“No, chorus first! All together now!”</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“I’d like to be a Monkey monk<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And live up in a tree;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I’d like to be a big Baboon,<br /></span>

<span class="i1">I’d wear a monkey-jacket and<br /></span>

<span class="i1">I’d wave the Stars and Stripes and be<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>“Next verse!” commanded Dan again.</p>

<p>“Oh, behave,” ordered Tom. “Cut out the
comedy.”</p>

<p>“He’s jealous of my beautiful voice,” said Alf.
“Oh, look at the pretty pictures. I shan’t go
another step until I’ve seen all the pretty pictures.”</p>

<p>So they stopped in front of a board fence which
was gaudily adorned with circus posters while
Alf feasted his eyes.</p>

<p>“It’s a good idea, you know,” he explained
philosophically, “to enjoy the pictures, because
they’re fifty times better than the circus. Now,
Gerald, there, in his innocence, doubtless expects
to see seven elephants doing a cake-walk and balancing
themselves on red and blue seesaws, like
that. But the fact is that there’ll be just two
elephants, one old, old elephant, moth-eaten and
decrepit, and one extremely young and frolicsome
elephant about the size of a Shetland pony. And
the old elephant won’t do much because he’s too
aged, and the young elephant will just look on
because he’s too young and tender for work.
Lies, lies, beautiful lies!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, come on,” laughed Dan. “We won’t get
any seats if we don’t hustle.”</p>

<p>“Wait, wait until I see the boa-constrictor and
the be-oot-shus lady. She thinks he’s a new set
of furs. See the way she’s wrapping him around
her neck? Someone ought to tell her; it’s a
shame. I’ll undeceive her when I arrive, all right,
all right. And, oh, the cunning little zebras!
Wouldn’t you love to have a cunning little zebra
to ride on, Dan? My, oh my! I’d ride to Chapel
on it every morning and hitch it to the statue of
Apollo outside Room D. And, fellows, fellows!
Observe, pray, the marvelous—”</p>

<p>But he was dragged resisting away.</p>

<p>“Say, didn’t you ever just <em>cry</em> to be in a circus,
Tom?” he inquired as they took up their journey
again. “I have. Why, I used to think that if
I could wear pink tights and hang from a
trapeze by my toes at the top of a circus tent I’d
be happy for life! If I ever get very, very
wealthy I shall have a circus of my own, Tom.
And I’ll let Dan and Gerald come in free, but
you will have to pay, Tom, because you’re so
hard-hearted and wouldn’t let me see the pictures;
you’ll have to pay all of seventeen nice bright
pins!”</p>

<p>“Oh, shut up,” growled Tom. “Folks’ll think
you’re dippy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>“Great scheme!” Alf exclaimed radiantly.
“When we get to the tent I’ll put my cap on inside
out and make faces and jibber and be a Wild
Man from Wissining! And you chaps can collect
dimes from the audience and we’ll go up to Parker’s
afterwards and buy ice-cream sodas. Marvelous!
<em>Marvelous!</em>”</p>

<p>The circus occupied a waste lot on the farther
side of the town, and it was a good half-hour’s
walk from Yardley. But they reached it in plenty
of time to view the animals in the outer tent before
it was time to repair to the circus proper.
And Alf had a glorious time and kept the others
in a continual howl of laughter. Several other
Yardley fellows joined their party and listened
convulsed while Alf addressed the rhinoceros.</p>

<p>“Beautiful Beast!” declaimed Alf. “Child of
the trackless jungle! Denizen of the African
waste, we salute you! (Salute, you idiots!) Thou
art indeed handsome! Thou art verily the Tom
Dyer of the Animal Kingdom. Thou art even
more so and then some, for Tom has no horn on
his nose. Even thy beautiful feet resemble his
and thou hastest the same simple grandeur of
contour, whatever that is. And thou also hastest
a noble grouchiness of expression which remindest
us of our dear Tom. Hast a name, Little One?
No? Sayest thou so? Alack and well-a-day!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
Thou shalt be named and right nobly, O Timorous
Nightingale of the Dark Continent! Hereafter
thou shalt be known as Tom. Arise, Tom, and
chortle thy glee and dance flitsomely! See him
dance flitsomely, fellows?”</p>

<p>The rhinoceros neither altered attitude nor expression,
however, and Alf was dragged away to
see the Royal Bengal Tiger, whom he addressed
as “Kitty.”</p>

<p>“Say, Tom,” said Dan presently, when they
had completed the circuit of the tent, “I’ll bet
all Broadwood is here. I’ve seen dozens of fellows
already.”</p>

<p>“Really?” asked Tom, with a grin. “Say,
we’ll have some fun, then.” He acquainted the
others with Dan’s news and a howl of glee arose.</p>

<p>“We’ll get our crowd all together,” said Alf,
“and have a little cheering to waken things up a
bit. Come on.”</p>

<p>So they made their way into the tent, which
was already half filled, and chose seats in an unoccupied
section. Then:</p>

<p>“Yardley, this way!” was the cry. “Yardley,
this way!”</p>

<p>Yardley responded quickly and in two minutes
that section of the stand was filled with some two
hundred youths.</p>

<p>“Now, fellows,” announced Alf, who had constituted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
himself Master of Ceremonies, “let’s give
a cheer for the elephant!”</p>

<p>They gave it; and followed up with one for the
tiger; and followed that up with one for the
monkeys.</p>

<p>“And now, fellows,” Alf cried gleefully, “let’s
have one for Broadwood!”</p>

<p>So they cheered Broadwood—after the monkeys—amidst
much laughter from their own section
and the adjoining ones. No laughter, however,
came from the stand across the tent where Broadwood
was concentrating her forces. A minute
afterwards Broadwood accepted the challenge and
began cheering, following the cheers with football
songs. And in the midst of that there was a
blare of music from the red-coated band and the
grand procession appeared. Yardley applauded
mightily and cheered everything and everybody
that passed. And then comparative quiet returned
and the exhibitions in the rings began.</p>

<p>It wasn’t a very large circus, but it was a good
one, and the fellows enjoyed it all hugely. When
the trick donkey appeared with the leading clown
seated on his back belaboring him with a bladder
on the end of a stick Paul Rand made the hit of
the afternoon by bawling loudly;</p>

<p>“<em>Whoa, Broadwood!</em>”</p>

<p>Even Broadwood thought that rather funny and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
laughed. But they tried for revenge later by dubbing
the trick elephant “Yardley.” And when
he finally managed to get all four feet onto a big
red and yellow ball of wood they demanded;
“Touchdown, Yardley, touchdown!”</p>

<p>And so the performance drew triumphantly to
its close while attendants passed around selling
tickets for the “Grand Concert and Minstrel Entertainment
to begin immediately after the show.”</p>

<p>Gerald, who had had a wonderful time all afternoon,
leaned forward and begged Dan to remain
and see the minstrel show. But Alf, who overheard,
said;</p>

<p>“It isn’t worth the price, Gerald. You stay
with the crowd and you’ll have lots more fun.”</p>

<p>“Why?” Gerald asked curiously. But Alf only
shook his head and looked mysterious. Then the
performance came to an end and the audience
surged toward the single exit. This was not the
way they had entered; instead of leading back
to the smaller tent it deposited the throng out in
the open air in front of the side-shows. This exit
was a good twelve feet wide and was formed by
an opening in the big tent and a canvas passageway
some fifteen feet in length. The passageway
was a smaller tent open at each end and supported
by half a dozen light poles and as many
guy-ropes. The inner walls were covered with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
cordial and gaudy invitations to the side-shows,
and a “barker,” armed with a small cane and a
resonant voice, stood under the alluring placards
and recited the attractions of “Fatima, the Turkish
Fortune Teller” and “Mademoiselle Marcelle,
the Most Marvelous Snake Charmer of the Century.”</p>

<p>“Hurry up,” whispered Alf as he seized Gerald’s
arm and dragged him through the throng.
The exit was close to the seats occupied by the
Yardley contingent and so they were soon outside.
There the Yardley fellows lined up about
the entrance and began cheering. Gerald, craning
his head over Alf’s shoulder, watched the exit
in excited expectation. He didn’t know what was
going to happen but he was certain something
would. Broadwood, hearing the Yardley cheers,
came to a similar conclusion and kept her forces
well together as she made for the exit. For a
minute or two the emerging stream was composed
of townsfolk, and the Yardley cheers continued.
Gerald looked about for Dan, but couldn’t see him.
Alf, when questioned, replied enigmatically that
Dan had been assigned to duty. Gerald’s further
inquiries were interrupted.</p>

<p>“Here they come!” someone announced in a
stage-whisper, and Gerald saw the fore-rank of
Broadwood emerging from the big tent into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
passageway. Instantly Alf was leading a mighty
cheer for “Broadwood! Broadwood! Broadwood!”
Some of the oncoming army grinned approval
at the compliment, but there were more
who scowled suspiciously, pulled their caps firmer
on their heads, and buttoned their jackets.</p>

<p>“Oh, oh!” murmured Alf delightedly. “Like
sheep to the slaughter! Good old Broadwood!
A-ay, Broadwood! Broadwood!”</p>

<p>And then, just as the first of the Broadwood
fellows had reached the outer end of the passageway,
a voice shouted “<em>Let her go!</em>” Gerald
found himself being pressed back. There were
cries of delight all about him. The canvas passageway
swayed, the roof and walls settled inward
and the tent descended calmly, inexorably
upon the struggling crowd beneath. There was
a wild and prolonged howl of joy from Yardley,
a smothered babel of alarm and consternation
from under the heaving canvas, and then Gerald,
with Alf dragging him along, found himself flying
wildly from the scene, tripping over ropes, colliding
with persons, and shouting triumphantly as
he went.</p>

<p>A quarter of a mile away the flying hordes of
Yardley drew pace and breath, cheered approvingly
for themselves and tauntingly for Broadwood,
and then, forming into lines eight abreast,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
marched in triumph back to school singing their
songs. When, breathless and exultant, Tom, Alf,
Dan, and Gerald found themselves in Number 7
Dudley, Gerald alone expressed a regret.</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you let me help cut the ropes?”
he asked Alf.</p>

<p>“Cut the ropes?” asked Alf. “Why, child,
how you do talk! Nobody didn’t cut no ropes!”</p>

<p>“Then how did they get the tent down?” persisted
Gerald, looking from Alf to Dan and from
Dan to Tom.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Alf, settling himself comfortably on
the window-seat, “that’s what you might term a
coincidence. Of course we don’t know anything
for certain, but it does look as though the guy-ropes
all got loosened at the same moment. Then
the natural thing happened; the tent came down.
It certainly was a surprise to me! Why, I no
more looked for anything like that to happen than—than—”</p>

<p>“Well,” laughed Tom, “it means that there
won’t be any circus for Yardley next Spring.”</p>

<p>“Which is a very good thing,” responded Alf
virtuously. “I am convinced that circuses are
bad for us; they take our thoughts away from
our studies, and—and lead us into temptation.
No circus, no tent; no tent, no guy-ropes; no guy-ropes,
no—ahem—coincidences!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>“Besides,” said Tom, “you and I will be too
busy trying to pass final exams to have any time
for circuses.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right for you fellows,” said Gerald
mournfully, “but I like circuses, and I want to
go next year.”</p>

<p>“Away with vain regrets,” cried Alf gayly.
“Comfort yourself with the knowledge that you
have witnessed the glorification of Yardley and
the discomfiture of Broadwood. Recall, I pray,
the lines of the poet:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“‘Something accomplished, something done<br /></span>
<span class="i4">To earn a night’s repose!’”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Of course the Faculty didn’t remain long in
ignorance of the incident and the next morning
Mr. Collins read the School a short but eloquent
lecture on the subject of Behavior in Public. But
the matter ended there. A Second Class boy
named Farnham, seeking Mr. Collins’ room the
evening before by appointment, had found the
host and Mr. Austin, another of the instructors,
laughing loudly, and although they had sobered
down instantly when they had heard his knock
on the partly opened door, Farnham had overheard
enough to convince him that the subject of
their mirth had been the tent episode. When this
had percolated through School, as it very shortly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
did, all fear of punishment faded. Mr. Collins
wasn’t formidable when he laughed.</p>

<p>A few days later Mr. Pennimore’s retinue of
servants came down from the city and opened
Sound View for the summer. Gerald spent an
hour at the station that morning between recitations
watching the stablemen unload the horses
and traps and hobnobbing with Higgins, the chauffeur,
who, having driven his car down by road,
was taking a hand in the unloading. In the afternoon
Gerald went over home and patronized the
housekeeper until the good soul was quite in awe
of him. The house was all ready for Mr. Pennimore’s
arrival, and that gentleman was expected
in two or three days. Gerald spent a half hour
in his own rooms going through his belongings.
Strange to say, many things which had been precious
to him not much more than six months before
to-day held no attractions. Very soon he had a
pile of toys and playthings in the middle of the
floor and was directing their removal and destruction.
He got his stamp albums down and
looked through them listlessly, replacing them
with a frown.</p>

<p>“Any fellow can collect stamps,” he muttered.
“I’m going to give those away to someone.
Maybe Harry would like them.”</p>

<p>Then he climbed the stairs to the gymnasium<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
which his father had had arranged for him three
years before and looked about it superciliously.
It wasn’t much like the gymnasium at school, he
thought. He did the giant swing on the rings,
pulled once or twice at the chest-weights and
turned his back on the room.</p>

<p>“Good enough for a kid,” he muttered as he
went downstairs, “but I won’t use it much, I
guess.” He looked at his watch, found he had
still time to reach the field before baseball practice
ended, and took his departure.</p>

<p>Two days later, just at noon, as he was crossing
from Oxford to Clarke the boom of a gun reached
him. Hurrying to the edge of The Prospect, he
looked seaward. There, circling in toward Sound
View, a little cloud of smoke still wreathing at
her bow, was a great white steam yacht. It was
the Princess! With beating heart Gerald watched.
The big boat slowed down, an anchor splashed
into the sea, and the jar and jangle of the chain
running through the hawse-hole came to him.
Amidship a boom swung outward, a little launch
was lowered from deck to water, white-clad figures
moved here and there, and then a form in
dark clothes went down the steps, and—</p>

<p>But now Gerald was racing down the terrace,
across the bridge and along the wood path to meet
his father.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX</a><br />
<small>WHAT PELL SCHOOL DID</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Dan learned of Mr. Pennimore’s arrival after
school.</p>

<p>“I told him you couldn’t come over this afternoon,”
said Gerald, “on account of practice. So
he said I must bring you to dinner at seven.”</p>

<p>“Gee! I’d like to go,” answered Dan wistfully,
“but there wouldn’t be anything I could eat, I
guess. It isn’t exactly a training table you folks
set, Gerald. Besides, even if you had cold roast
beef or poached eggs and such things, I’d want to
eat the whole menu. I wish I wasn’t in training.”</p>

<p>“You don’t either,” said Gerald indignantly.
“You’re mighty proud of it, and you know it!
My! I wish I was in your place! Harry Merrow
says you’re certain to get into the Broadwood
game, Dan.”</p>

<p>Dan shook his head sadly.</p>

<p>“Merrow is a good little chap,” he said, “but
I’ll never get into the Broadwood game unless
they let me in for a minute at the end to give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
me my Y. And as I’ve got two more years that
isn’t likely. Of course I don’t want anything to
happen to Condit, but—” Followed an eloquent
silence.</p>

<p>“You can play just as well as he can,” said
Gerald stoutly.</p>

<p>“No, I can’t. That is, I know the game as well,
maybe, but he’s been on the team a year already
and he knows what to do and how to do it. He’s
had more experience. Oh, I don’t care—much.
Maybe I’ll make it next year. The trouble is,
though, that Condit will be here then, too.”</p>

<p>“Danforth won’t, though,” replied Gerald.
“He’s a First Class man. You might make second
next year, Dan.”</p>

<p>“I hadn’t thought of that,” said Dan more
cheerfully. “I’d rather make second, too. Why
don’t you bring your father up to-morrow to see
the game, Gerald? Wouldn’t he care for it?”</p>

<p>“I will. It’s Pell School, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and the last game before Broadwood.
We’re going to get licked, they say. Now, about
this evening, Gerald. I can’t come to dinner but
I want to see your father awfully. Suppose I
come over afterwards?”</p>

<p>“Of course! And we’ll come home together.
Father can’t understand why I don’t want to go
over there to live. But he says I can stay on here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
until school closes if I’ll take luncheon and dinner
with him. I must see Mr. Collins about it.”</p>

<p>“And I must dig out for practice. I guess,
though, there won’t be much work this afternoon.
Hello, did someone knock?”</p>

<p>It was Harry Merrow. He wanted Gerald to
go canoeing with him, but Gerald explained that
his father had returned and that he was going
over there for the afternoon. So Harry decided
to go down to the field with Dan and watch practice.
They parted in front of Oxford, Gerald
running in to the Office to get permission from Mr.
Collins to spend all the time he wanted at Sound
View and the other two continuing around to the
gymnasium. Dan found himself on third base
when practice began, for, although the regulars
were to have an easy time of it in view of the hard
contest set for the morrow, the substitutes were
put through a strenuous afternoon.</p>

<p>Supper over, Dan set out for Sound View and
found a hearty welcome awaiting him. Mr. Pennimore
had to have a full account from Dan of
everything that had transpired since his departure
abroad. Dan tried to hurry over that part of
his narrative which concerned Gerald’s unannounced
departure from school, but Mr. Pennimore
wanted full details. He shook his head
when Dan had finished.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>“I didn’t think you were of the run-away kind,
Gerald,” he said regretfully. Gerald looked
rather ashamed.</p>

<p>“Well, sir, it was a silly thing to do,” said Dan,
“but Gerald had a lot of troubles about that time,
Mr. Pennimore.”</p>

<p>“Running away doesn’t help,” replied Gerald’s
father dryly. “The troubles can always run
faster than you can. Next time, son, you hold
your ground and fight it out.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, I will next time,” answered Gerald.
“I—I know better now.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s something. I don’t see but what
you’ve been learning a good many things—beside
algebra.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” said Gerald meekly. Dan smiled as
he caught the twinkle in Mr. Pennimore’s eye.</p>

<p>“I suppose you’re doing pretty good work in
algebra now, son?”</p>

<p>“I expect to get C plus, sir,” said Gerald
eagerly.</p>

<p>“C; hm; that’s the highest mark, is it?”</p>

<p>“N-no, sir, you can get a B—sometimes.”</p>

<p>“How about an A?”</p>

<p>Gerald shook his head decidedly. “Not from
Kilts, sir. They say he never gave anyone an A
but once and then it was a mistake.”</p>

<p>“That’s true, sir,” laughed Dan. “B plus is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
about the best you can expect from Kilts.”</p>

<p>“Well, if that is so you’re doing pretty well,
aren’t you, Gerald?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; Kilts says so himself.”</p>

<p>“And how about other studies?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t mind them,” replied Gerald carelessly.
“Maybe I will get an A in English. Say,
though, you just ought to have been here and seen
the Class Games! Weren’t they great, Dan?”</p>

<p>And thereupon the conversation switched from
the dangerous topic of studies to the enthralling
one of baseball. Dan’s suggestion that perhaps
Mr. Pennimore would like to see the morrow’s
game with Pell School was well received and Mr.
Pennimore promised to accompany Gerald to that
event.</p>

<p>“I had already promised myself a vacation until
Monday,” he said, “so I could see something of
this good-for-nothing boy of mine. I find, however,
that my appearance on the scene is of much
less interest to him than the next ball game. I’m
afraid you’ve pretty effectually weaned him away
from me, Dan?”</p>

<p>“We’re all rather excited about baseball just
now, sir,” replied Dan apologetically.</p>

<p>“And you’ve got to go over to Broadwood,
sir, and see the big game!” exclaimed Gerald
eagerly. “You will, won’t you? We could go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
over in the car and have a dandy time. You
could ride over with us, couldn’t you, Dan?”</p>

<p>“Afraid I’ll have to go in the barge with the
team,” answered Dan. “I wish you could see
that game, though, Mr. Pennimore. It will be
a fine one.”</p>

<p>“Well, we will see. Perhaps I can. Saturday,
you say? I’ll think it over.”</p>

<p>Mr. Pennimore watched the contest the next
afternoon from a seat in the grand stand, Gerald
beside him. Mr. Pennimore didn’t know when he
had last seen a baseball game and he had to have
a good many things explained to him. But he had
a competent and willing tutor, and long before
the game was at an end he had become imbued
with some of Gerald’s enthusiasm, and, if he didn’t
jump out of his seat every two minutes and yell
himself hoarse after the manner of his companion,
he became much interested and shared Gerald’s
sorrow and disappointment at the outcome of the
match.</p>

<p>For Yardley went down in ignominious defeat
that day. Ignominious is not too strong a term,
either. Yardley played, to quote Payson, the
coach, “like a lot of babies.” Just what the
trouble was no one seemed to know, although one
heard all sorts of explanations offered after the
game was over and Pell School had departed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
cheering and happy, with one more victory added
to their long list for the season. Yardley had
played mighty poor ball; that was the long and
short of it. They seemed to have forgotten everything
they had ever known about batting, fielding,
base-running, and team work. Even the redoubtable
Colton, who had been sent into the box in the
sixth inning to save the game, had failed to pitch
his wonted game, and had been unmercifully
slammed around the lot. The final score was 8
to 1, and an unbiased critic, had there been one on
hand, would have told you that the score didn’t
begin to show the relative merits of the two teams
as they played that day. Pell School simply overwhelmed
her opponent, taking quick advantage of
every misplay, batting like National Leaguers,
and running the bases like mice.</p>

<p>Payson was discouraged. There had been no
slump all season, and now it had come at the
eleventh hour, and he very greatly doubted
whether in the four days of practice which remained
before the final game the team could be
brought together again in condition. It was one
of the worst slumps he had ever had to contend
with, and the situation looked pretty desperate to
him.</p>

<p>The team and substitutes trotted back to the
gymnasium after the game with no pleasant anticipations.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
That they would receive a frightful
wigging from Payson was a foregone conclusion;
that some of them might lose their places was not
improbable. But Payson, after looking over the
tired, anxious faces before him for a moment,
closed his lips tightly, swung on his heel and left
them. He might, he told himself, have said a
great many things, but they were in no condition
to hear them. Fault-finding wasn’t going to help
at this crisis. If the fellows were to be brought
back to their game, they must be rested and encouraged,
and encouragement was something Payson
couldn’t give them that afternoon.</p>

<p>His unexpected departure left the team dazed,
and for a moment no one made a sound. Then
little Durfee, the shortstop, who was only a Third
Class boy and might be forgiven a show of emotion,
put one bare arm over his eyes and began
to sob. That broke the tension.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Millener grimly, “what he had to
say must have been pretty bad if he couldn’t say
it. Now, look here, you fellows!”</p>

<p>Every one turned toward him, and even the rubber
stopped his administrations.</p>

<p>“Payson couldn’t talk, but I can. And I say
we—mind you, I say <em>we</em>, for I was as rotten as any
of you—I say, we ought to be whipped, every one
of us, for the fool exhibition we made of ourselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
to-day. You know it, too. There wasn’t a man
on the team played his real game. We were a
poor lot. That’s all for that. There’s another
week before the Broadwood game. It’s enough,
too. Let’s get down to work on Monday and put
our hearts into it. I don’t say let’s forget to-day’s
game; I say let’s remember it. Let’s remember it
a week from to-day, and show Broadwood that
we aren’t the lot of rotters Pell School made us
look to be. Let’s show the School that we can
play ball, after all, and that they aren’t mistaken
in putting faith in us. Let’s work—and fight—and
play the game as we <em>can</em> play it! What do
you say?”</p>

<p>What they said was a lot. And it was very
loud and very earnest, and after they had said it
every fellow felt a whole lot better, even little
Durfee drying his eyes shame-facedly, and summoning
a brave smile to his face.</p>

<p>Dan felt the enthusiasm as well as the rest, and
only wished that he might have the chance that
the others would have of proving himself. He
had sat on the bench all the afternoon, watching
and waiting and hoping. But, irony of ironies,
where all the team had played poor ball, there
was one who had done a little better than the
rest; and that one was Condit! Dan was disheartened.
Even Danforth, the crack second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
baseman, had been outplayed by Condit; in fact,
Danforth had managed to make about as poor an
exhibition of himself as possible, letting hit after
hit go through his position, and missing more than
one throw to second. But Danforth’s demoralization
brought Dan no comfort, for Danforth, he
knew, was a fellow who would make good the next
time; Danforth had proved himself time and
again. No, try as he would, Dan couldn’t see
himself in the Broadwood game, and he took his
way back to Clarke, the one silent member of the
little throng of players and substitutes, feeling
rather out of it.</p>

<p>But by Monday he had reached a more philosophical
frame of mind. Up until Saturday he
had hoped. Now he had stopped hoping and
found that he could be quite cheerful. He might
possibly get into the game for an inning or a half
an inning, and, anyway, there was another year
coming. Besides, life was pretty busy nowadays,
and there wasn’t much time for thought, happy
or regretful. In a little more than a week Graduation
Day would come, bringing the end of the
school year and the commencement of the Summer
holidays. Meanwhile, the First Class fellows
went about with worried countenances and
absent-minded glances, being in the middle of
final examinations. All the other fellows were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
doing finals, too, but it isn’t so serious when
you’re not graduating and when a diploma doesn’t
depend on your ability to present in a few hours
what it has taken you a whole school year to
store up.</p>

<p>The Weather Man had evidently determined to
do all he could to make the final week of school
memorably pleasant. Monday started in with a
clear sky, and the hottest of June suns. Tuesday
the sky was even bluer and clearer, and the sun
hotter. And so it went, day after day, with the
thermometer up in the eighties. What breezes
there were, were tiny, timid, ineffectual little
breaths that scarcely stirred the limp leaves. On
Thursday a great bank of white clouds rolled up
from the horizon and at three o’clock a mighty
thunder storm was splitting open the heavens and
deluging the earth. It lasted only an hour or so,
however, and then went off muttering and rumbling
into the east, and the sun came out again
as jovially ardent as ever. Friday brought unclouded
skies, and Saturday dawned hot and
clear, and the School, final examinations over with
for good or bad, and only the Broadwood baseball
game to think about, rejoiced and was glad.</p>

<p>But I am far ahead of my story, for many
things happened before Saturday’s sun came
blazing up out of the east.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX</a><br />
<small>THE SLUMP</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Contrary to expectation, Monday’s baseball
practice was easy and short. Payson was affable,
smiling, unhurried. Apparently he hadn’t a care
in the world to-day. There was a brief session at
the batting net, followed by fielding practice for
infielders and outfielders. And then, when the
fellows looked for a game with the Second team,
Payson waved his hand in dismissal.</p>

<p>The players were distinctly disappointed. They
had nerved themselves up for a hard afternoon,
determined to work as they had never worked before,
and they hadn’t been given a chance to distinguish
themselves! They felt cheated and cast
somber looks at the coach as they trotted off.
They had been fully prepared, even anxious, to
suffer martyrdom, and instead had been treated
like so many little kids. It wasn’t fair! They
wanted to be raged at, scolded, driven; and here
they were trotting up the hill to the gymnasium
after the easiest sort of practice, as fresh and
untired as you please! What sort of a way was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
this to prepare for the Broadwood game? Didn’t
Payson realize that there remained only three
days for practice? They talked it over amongst
themselves disgustedly and the consensus of
opinion was that Payson believed them to be stale
and was afraid to work them.</p>

<p>“Stale!” exclaimed Alf. “Poppycock! Why,
if I felt any better I’d go to work!”</p>

<p>“Well, he will take it out of us to-morrow,”
said Danforth hopefully, and every one brightened
up. But Danforth was mistaken, for Tuesday’s
practice was much like Monday’s. They were
kept out a quarter of an hour longer, but Payson
still wore the same look of untroubled ease he had
worn the day before, and not once did he find fault.
Corrections were suggested pleasantly now and
then, but no harsh, compelling demands to “Ginger
up, now!” or “Get into it! Get into it!”
passed the coach’s lips. When he wasn’t batting
up, Payson stood, for the most part, in tranquil
conversation with Andy Ryan, the trainer.</p>

<p>The result was that Captain Millener and the
players themselves took affairs into their own
hands, and as soon as it became evident that Payson
didn’t care whether they worked hard or not,
they began to make things hum. While it lasted
it was the snappiest practice of the year. When,
all too soon, Payson called a halt, the fellows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
went off secretly exultant; they had done their
work well in spite of Payson!</p>

<p>“I guess we showed him!” whispered little
Durfee to Reid, casting a triumphant glance at
Payson. “We’ll win that game Saturday whether
he wants us to or not!”</p>

<p>After the fellows had left the field, Payson and
Ryan fell into step and followed them up the
path to the gymnasium. There was admiration
in the trainer’s tone as he turned to the coach
with:</p>

<p>“Well, sir, it worked like you said it would!
I’d never have believed it!” Payson nodded.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he replied, “they think they’re getting
the best of me, and they’re tickled to death.” He
smiled. “I’ll have to give them a little stiffer
practice to-morrow, or they’ll mob me!”</p>

<p>But there was one player who, even though he
was only a substitute, wasn’t fooled. That was
Dan. He and Alf talked it over in the latter’s
room that evening, while Tom and Gerald played
chess.</p>

<p>“Don’t you fool yourself,” said Dan. “Payson
knows what he’s doing, Alf. This afternoon
when Millener was ragging Smith for not running
in with the ball after catching a fly, I saw Payson
grinning away like anything. He thought no one
was looking. But I was. He just made up his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
mind that if he let you fellows alone for a few
days you’d get mad and play the game just to
spite him! And you’re doing it, too!”</p>

<p>“‘Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings,’”
murmured Alf. “Well, maybe you’re right, O
Solomon the Great. I believe you are. For it
isn’t like Payson to get cold feet; he isn’t a quitter,
not by a long shot! Anyhow, it worked. We
had the worst case of slump I ever did see last
Saturday, and now every fellow’s on his toes
again, and just aching for work. If we keep it
up we’ll give Broadwood the biggest surprise of
their lives on Saturday. I wouldn’t be surprised
if that licking that Pell School gave us turned out
to be a very fortunate thing. We’re all hot under
the collar about it. We want to get back at some
one, and Broadwood’s the only victim in sight.
Yes, I believe there’ll be a whole lot doing Saturday!
Say, that was a dandy two-bagger of
yours to-day. Just a nice, clean hit that came
when it was needed. Why don’t you do that sort
of thing oftener? You’d make the team in a
minute, if you did.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess it was an accident,” replied Dan.
“I’ve about concluded that it’s always an accident
when I connect with the ball. I can’t judge ’em
for a cent.”</p>

<p>“Well, keep at it. We’ll have you on second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
next year, all right. How did you get along with
exams to-day?”</p>

<p>“Fair, I guess. How about you?” Alf made
a face.</p>

<p>“Bad. I couldn’t remember a thing they’d
ever taught me in math this morning. Still, I answered
five out of nine, and that’s something.
Oh, I’ll pass all right, I guess.”</p>

<p>“I did better than that,” laughed Dan, “but I
don’t know how many answers were correct. By
the way, Gerald, I sat next to your friend Thompson
at exams this morning. I think he wanted
to ask after your health, only Old Tige kept too
close a watch on us.”</p>

<p>Gerald paused in his battle and looked across
with a smile.</p>

<p>“If he ever does ask after my health,” he responded,
“you just tell him that I’m feeling
strong and willing.”</p>

<p>“Good boy!” laughed Alf. “It’s remarkable,
though, isn’t it, the way Gerald’s bloodthirstiness
has waned? A couple of months or so ago he
couldn’t wait to engage Thompson in mortal combat.
And now that I’ve taught him how to fight
he just sits around and plays chess with questionable
characters.”</p>

<p>“You do love a scrap, Alf, don’t you?” asked
Dan with a smile. Alf nodded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>“Pretty well, thanks. My trouble is that I
can’t find any one to scrap with I can’t lick with
both eyes shut.” He looked slyly at Tom. Tom
grunted without raising his eyes from the chess
board.</p>

<p>“Both eyes shut before or after the scrap?”
asked Gerald innocently.</p>

<p>“That’ll be about all from you, young Mr. Pennimore,”
replied Alf. “I’m disappointed in you.
I thought you were going to square yourself with
Thompson as soon as you could use your hands
a bit. What’s the trouble? Have you two kissed
and made up?”</p>

<p>“I just don’t take any notice of him any more,”
replied Gerald calmly. “If I quarreled with him
now, he’d think it was because he kept me out of
Cambridge.”</p>

<p>“I suppose he did do it?” inquired Tom.</p>

<p>“Of course,” Alf answered. “Who else was
there? But you’re right, Gerald; you can’t quarrel
with him for that.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t absolutely necessary for Gerald to
quarrel with Thompson about anything, is it?”
asked Dan idly.</p>

<p>“N-no, I suppose not,” Alf laughed. “Only
it seems such a waste of—of ability! Here’s
Gerald a perfectly good boxer and nothing doing.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got the punching-bag,” said Gerald.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
“I’ve been giving that some awful jolts, Alf.”</p>

<p>“Serves it right. Say, Tom, do you remember
the mean trick the fellows put up on Tubby Jones
last year? Did Tubby ever tell you about that,
Dan? I guess he wouldn’t, though; Tubby never
relished jokes on himself much.”</p>

<p>“I don’t remember,” said Tom. “Tubby had
so many jokes played on him. What was this
one, Alf?”</p>

<p>“I was thinking of the time Warren and Hadlock
and Dyer and two or three other fellows tied
the punching-bag back, and—”</p>

<p>“I remember,” chuckled Tom. “It almost
killed Tubby, though.”</p>

<p>“He was more scared than hurt,” said Alf.</p>

<p>“What was it?” Dan asked. “What did they
do?”</p>

<p>“Took a piece of stout cord and tied one end
to the punching-bag; hitched the other end of the
cord to one of the ladders, and pulled the bag back
until it was leaning over about like that, at an
angle of forty-five degrees. Then Warren told
Tubby he’d give him half a dollar if he’d stand
still and watch the minute hand of the clock for
five minutes. You see, Warren told him he
couldn’t stay awake that long.”</p>

<p>“That wasn’t it,” interrupted Tom. “Tubby
was always leaning against something when he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
wasn’t sitting down or lying down, and Warren
bet him he couldn’t stand up straight for five
minutes. Tubby thought he could, and needed the
money.”</p>

<p>“Was that it? Well, anyhow, Tubby took the
bet, and Warren and Hadlock and some others
went out on the floor and put Tubby in front of the
punching-bag, opposite the clock.”</p>

<p>“Gee!” murmured Gerald.</p>

<p>“So Tubby plants himself with his back to the
bag, and Hadlock says ‘Go!’ and Tubby watches
the clock. ‘One minute,’ says Hadlock. ‘Two
minutes.’ And then, ‘Three minutes!’ Poor
Tubby’s eyes were watering from watching the
minute hand so hard, and he was grinning like a
catfish at the thought of winning the fifty cents.
Then, ‘Four minutes!’ announces Hadlock, and
the crowd, which had grown pretty big by this
time, begins to cheer. ‘Four and a half!’ says
Hadlock, and then Dyer comes down on the cord
with his knife—<em>zip!</em>—and Mister Bag shoots out—<em>biff!</em>—and
Tubby does a grand tumble. The
bag hit him square on the back of the head and
he went about five feet through the air before he
landed. Luckily they’d spread a couple of mattresses
in front of him. If they hadn’t, he might
have broken his nose, for he came down plumb
on his face. It was the biggest surprise Tubby<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
ever had, I guess, and he was so scared when they
picked him up that he couldn’t speak. After a
bit he found his tongue, though, and then the
things he said were a plenty. Hadlock tried to
soothe him down; told him it was a shame he’d
lost by half a minute, and if he liked they’d try it
again. But Tubby wasn’t enthusiastic.”</p>

<p>“Was he hurt?” asked Gerald anxiously.</p>

<p>“No, not a bit; except that he had a bad headache
the rest of the day, I believe. That did
Tubby good, though, Tom. He was never nearly
so fresh after that.”</p>

<p>“He needed it,” Tom grunted. “He wasn’t
so bad when he roomed with you last Fall, Dan,
but the year before he was an awful little fat
beast. Your move, Gerald.”</p>

<small>DROWNED!</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The next afternoon, Wednesday, baseball practice
started off with a dash that secretly delighted
Payson’s heart. Outwardly, however, he was as
calm and untroubled as ever. Alf had confided
Dan’s theory to Millener, but the captain had let
it go no further, and the team still labored under
the delusion that they were spiting the coach.
At the batting net, fellows who were scarcely
known to hit the ball safely, worked in a perfect
frenzy of ambition and pounded the leather all
around the field. This put Reid, the substitute
pitcher, on his mettle, and a regular duel ensued
between him and the eager batters.</p>

<p>Gerald and Harry Merrow, on their way to the
boathouse, paused a while behind the net and
watched proceedings. One by one the players
faced Reid until he had made some sort of a hit;
Millener, Colton, Loring, Condit, Danforth, Durfee,
Richards, and so on down the list of first
team men and substitutes. When Alf cracked out
a long, low drive that would have been good for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
three bases in a game, Gerald howled with glee,
and again, when Dan managed to send a hard,
low one just over Reid’s head, Gerald shouted
“Good for you, Dan!” and didn’t at all mind the
amusement he created. When the players left the
net and trotted over to the diamond, Gerald and
Harry continued on their way to the river, discussing
the nine and the chances of victory.
Harry was pessimistic.</p>

<p>“Broadwood’s got a crackajack of a team this
year,” he said. “Look at the way they licked
Porter! And that fellow Herring, their best
pitcher, is a wonder. I saw him pitch last year.”</p>

<p>“Is he better than Colton?” asked Gerald.
Harry frowned and hesitated.</p>

<p>“Well, he’s as good. But he isn’t the all-round
player that Colton is. Colton can bat, you know;
he’s the best batter we’ve got.”</p>

<p>“Alf Loring’s good, too,” said Gerald jealously.</p>

<p>“You bet he is! He and Colton are both
dandies! Oh, it’s going to be a ripping game,
all right. I wouldn’t miss it for anything. But,
just the same, I look to see Broadwood win, say
about five to four, or something like that.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe she will,” answered Gerald.</p>

<p>“Want to bet?” asked Harry eagerly.</p>

<p>“I don’t bet, but—say, I’ll tell you what I will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
do, Harry. I’ve got a dandy stamp collection;
three big books; some of them cost a lot of money.
I’ve got almost all the real rare ones, too. Do
you collect?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I used to. But I haven’t had any new
ones lately. Why?”</p>

<p>“Well, if Broadwood wins I’ll give you my collection.”</p>

<p>“The—the whole thing?” asked Harry incredulously.
Gerald nodded. Harry thought a moment,
and then asked suspiciously;</p>

<p>“And if we win, what do I give you?”</p>

<p>“Nothing. If you did it would be just the same
as betting, and father won’t let me bet. Is it a
go?”</p>

<p>“Sure!” answered Harry. “Only—only it’s
pretty one-sided, isn’t it? It doesn’t seem just
right to take the stamps, Gerald.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right. Besides, I don’t believe
you’ll have a chance. We’re going to win.”</p>

<p>“You wait and see,” said Harry. “How many
stamps have you got?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t counted them lately,” replied
Gerald carelessly. “Over two thousand, though.”
Harry whistled. “I guess it’s only fair, though,
to tell you that I—I’m tired of them. If you win
I shan’t care much about the stamps, I mean.”</p>

<p>“I shall,” laughed Harry. “I don’t really<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
want Broadwood to win, but—but, gee, I’d like to
have those books!”</p>

<p>They lifted their canoe out, set it in the water
and climbed into it.</p>

<p>“Where’ll we go?” asked Harry.</p>

<p>“Let’s go up to Flat Island, and then into
Marsh Lake on the way back,” answered Gerald.
“There’s Dyer and Burgess up there in that blue
canoe. See ’em? Ready?”</p>

<p>They dug their paddles and headed upstream.
There were a good many canoes out and Gerald
and Harry had one or two brisk encounters on
the way up. At Flat Island several canoes were
pulled up onto the shore and a number of fellows
were lolling about in the shade of the willows.
They went on by the island for a quarter of a
mile to where the river narrows, and then turned
and floated back with the tide. Harry had got
over his nervousness and no longer insisted on
being close to shore.</p>

<p>“This is something like,” he said, settling comfortably
down in the stern, where, with just a
touch of his paddle now and then he could keep
the canoe’s nose pointed right. And Gerald, laying
his paddle across his knees, agreed. It was
a beautiful afternoon, and the river never looked
lovelier. It was pretty warm, but now and then
a little breeze crept across the marshland, waving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
the tall, lush grasses, and brought relief. The
river reflected the intense blue of the sky, the
willows and alders along the bank were vividly
green, and to Gerald came the fanciful thought
that Nature was divided in its allegiance, displaying
equally the colors of Yardley and Broadwood.</p>

<p>“Just the same,” he muttered half aloud, with
a glance at the sky, “the blue’s on top!”</p>

<p>“Eh?” asked Harry sleepily.</p>

<p>To the left, over on the links, seven couples
dotted the turf. Golf enthusiasts these, so intent
on following the little white spheres that they had
no thought for the temperature. Further along
was the field, sprinkled with the blue-and-gray-uniformed
ball players. Occasionally, when the
breeze died away, the sharp crack of ball against
bat reached the occupants of the canoe. Presently
the mouth of the tiny stream which wound inward
to Marsh Lake was reached, and the lads took up
their paddles again to battle with the sluggish
current. The canoe was headed in between the
tall rushes, which in places almost met across the
little passage, and all their ingenuity was required
to keep their shallow craft from running aground
on the bars and flats. It was very hot in here,
and swarms of blood-thirsty mosquitoes were
lying in wait for the adventurers.</p>

<p>“Who suggested coming in here?” asked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
Gerald, pausing in his paddling to defend himself
from the hungry horde.</p>

<p>“You did,” responded Harry. “Don’t you
wish you hadn’t? I’m just a mass of bites already.”</p>

<p>“Well, let’s get out of it,” said Gerald.</p>

<p>“Let’s keep on; it’s only a little ways more.”</p>

<p>Another turn of the winding stream and the
bushes gave way and the canoe floated on Marsh
Lake, a good-sized sheet of water, set in a wide,
green sea of marsh grass and rushes, which extended
for a good half-mile to the westward, and
perhaps half that distance north and south. Now
and then a clump of low bushes or a group of small
willows stood up above the surrounding flatness.
Blackbirds and bobolinks and sparrows held high
carnival amidst the swaying reeds, frogs splashed
and challenged gruffly, and the hum of thousands
of insects filled the air. Into and out of the lake
dozens of little streams made their way, all so
much alike that it was the custom to thrust a
paddle into the bank as one entered, so as to distinguish
the outlet toward the river from the other
streams which meandered in meaningless fashion
across the marsh, twisting and doubling, and, in
many cases, leading nowhere at all. So Harry
stuck his paddle down into the mud at the bottom
of the lake, near the margin, and left Gerald to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
propel the craft across the unruffled water.</p>

<p>They went very quietly, for sometimes there
were adventures awaiting the visitor to Marsh
Lake. It was a favorite place for ducks and loons
and snipe, and more than one heron had been surprised
there. But to-day they discovered nothing
more remarkable than two big mud turtles, which
slipped into the water from the log upon which
they had been sunning themselves. A pair of
kingfishers came winging across the marsh, looking
for supper, but the first glimpse of the canoe
sent them wheeling northward, scolding discordantly.
Gerald paddled slowly around the lake,
fighting off the mosquitoes, which, if less troublesome
here than in the stream, were still annoying.</p>

<p>“Let’s go back,” he said finally. “There’s
nothing here to-day. Sometime I’m coming up
here to catch a turtle.”</p>

<p>“A dip-net’s the thing for them,” said Harry
knowingly. “I’ve got one at home, and I’ll bring
it along in the Fall.”</p>

<p>“I’ve heard you could catch them with a hook
and a piece of raw meat,” Gerald replied. “I’d
like to try it some time. Where’s that paddle,
Harry?” Harry looked around.</p>

<p>“It ought to be over there,” he said finally,
“but I don’t see it.”</p>

<p>“Neither do I. I thought, though, that—There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
it is; see? Gee, it’s lucky we put it there! I’d
never have gone out that way.”</p>

<p>“I would,” answered Harry. “The river’s toward
the east, you know, and—”</p>

<p>“And there are at least five outlets in that direction,”
finished Gerald sarcastically, as he sent
the canoe across the pond to where the paddle
stuck out of the water.</p>

<p>“Stop paddling,” said Harry. “I can get it.”</p>

<p>He reached out and took hold of the paddle and
gave it a tug.</p>

<p>“Come out of that,” he grunted.</p>

<p>“Wait till I push up nearer,” advised Gerald.</p>

<p>“Never mind; I can get it,” was the reply.
Harry stood up gingerly in the canoe, and gave a
mighty tug at the paddle. It came up so quickly
that he lost his balance, the paddle flew over his
head, and the canoe rocked dangerously. Making
a frantic effort to recover his balance, Harry fell
with one knee against the opposite edge of the
craft, and in the next moment both boys were in
the water.</p>

<p>Gerald came up sputtering and laughing.
“You’re a nice one!” he cried. He had kept hold
of his own paddle, but the one which had caused
the catastrophe was floating a good ten feet away,
while the canoe, which had promptly righted itself,
was rocking sluggishly, half full of water, just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
beyond reach. Gerald thought he could touch
bottom, but when he tried it, he found that in
spite of the fact that he was hardly a dozen feet
from shore, he was still over his depth. Then
he looked for Harry. That youth was nowhere
to be seen, and Gerald, with one hand on the
canoe, stared about him in perplexity and a growing
uneasiness.</p>

<p>“Harry!” he called.</p>

<p>There was no answer. The surface of the pond
was still and untroubled. For an instant he
thought that perhaps his companion had waded
ashore, and was hiding in the bushes and reeds.
But there hadn’t been time for that. With growing
horror, Gerald realized that Harry had not
come to the surface after he had sunk; that he
was down there—somewhere—caught, perhaps, in
the mud—drowning!</p>

<p>A wild desire for flight almost overpowered
him. For a moment longer he clung desperately
to the canoe, white of face and with staring eyes
fixed in terror on the calm surface of the treacherous
pond. Then, with an inarticulate cry and an
awful fear clutching at his heart, he tore himself
loose from the canoe and dove.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Baseball practice had been longer to-day, and
a five-inning game with the Second Nine had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
brought it to a close at a few minutes before five.
Up in the gymnasium there was a merry babel of
voices, mingled with the rushing of water in the
shower baths. Dan had played at third for a
part of the time, and now, glowing from his work
and the subsequent shower, he was dressing himself
leisurely and happily in the locker-room,
listening to the talk about him, and now and then
throwing in a word. The windows were open and
the steam was writhing out into the sunlight.
Payson had taken his departure and the discussion
of the day’s work was free and untrammelled.
To be sure, Andy Ryan was still present, but
every one knew that Andy never carried tales.
And so Lawrence, who played rightfield, and was
in the First Class, wasn’t mincing matters in his
loud criticism of Payson. Millener was trying to
“call him down,” but every one was talking at
once, and his efforts were not very successful.
The discussion was waxing vehement when the
swinging door at the foot of the stair was thrown
open and an excited youth stumbled in.</p>

<p><a href="#i_fp258">“Have you fellows heard the news?” he cried.</a></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 411px;">

<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_259">“‘Have you fellows heard the news?’ he cried.”</a></div>
</div>

<p>The confusion ceased and all faces turned toward
him.</p>

<p>“Young Pennimore and another fellow, Merrill,
or something like that, were drowned just now
over in Marsh Lake!”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII</a><br />
<small>THE RESCUE</small></h2>
</div>


<p>There was a moment of stunned silence. Then
twenty voices broke into ejaculations of surprise
and dismay, and the bearer of the tidings was
surrounded by a questioning group.</p>

<p>Dan sat an instant sick and faint. Then he
leaped to his feet and thrust his way through the
cluster of questioning fellows.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe it,” he said forcibly. “Where’d
you hear it?”</p>

<p>“It’s all over school,” answered the boy.
“They brought them back just now, and they’re
in Merle. And Arthur Thompson was with them,
and—”</p>

<p>“Thompson!” cried Dan. “Was he there?”</p>

<p>“Look here, Billy,” said Millener sternly, “did
you see the—the bodies?”</p>

<p>“No, I was in the village. Joe Dexter told me
just now in front of Oxford.”</p>

<p>“Did he see them?”</p>

<p>“I think so. Anyhow, it’s true, Millener.”</p>

<p>Dan felt a clutch on his arm and looked around
into the anxious face of Alf.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p>“Come,” he said gruffly, “and let’s find out the
truth about this. Where’s your jacket?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know; I don’t need it. Come on.”
As they ran across to the entrance of Merle Hall,
Dan turned fiercely to Alf. “If it’s true,” he
said, “and that chap Thompson had anything to
do with it, I’ll wring his neck! I’ll half kill
him!”</p>

<p>“And I’ll help,” answered Alf grimly.</p>

<p>The corridor of the building was filled with an
excited throng of fellows, attracted by the wild
rumors which had spread about the school. Alf
seized on the first fellow he met.</p>

<p>“Here,” he demanded, “what’s the truth about
this? Has any one been drowned?”</p>

<p>“They don’t know yet,” was the reply.
“They’re working over him now. They say—”</p>

<p>“Working over who?” interrupted Dan.</p>

<p>“Harry Merrow. They say he was under the
water almost five minutes, and—”</p>

<p>“And Pennimore?” gasped Dan.</p>

<p>“He’s all right. And Thompson, too. They
were here a minute ago.” Their informant
glanced eagerly around in the hope of being able
to exhibit them. “They had an awful time getting
him up. He was stuck in the mud. Look,
here comes the doctor now!”</p>

<p>It was the physician from Greenburg, and with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
him was Mr. Collins. The crowd in the corridor
stopped talking and made way for them. The
doctor viewed the anxious faces around him and
paused.</p>

<p>“Now, I’m going to ask you boys to be very
quiet this evening,” he announced. “Your friend
is doing very nicely, but I want him to have a good
long sleep. So just as little noise as possible,
please!”</p>

<p>He passed on, and a murmur of relief grew and
spread in the hall. Then by ones and twos the
fellows withdrew from the building or crept tip-toeing
to their rooms. Dan and Alf were already
hurrying across the Yard to Clarke.</p>

<p>“Gee,” said Dan, taking a long breath, “I was
scared!”</p>

<p>“So was I,” replied Alf soberly.</p>

<p>When they opened the door of Number 28,
Gerald, attired in his dressing-gown, was sitting
on the edge of his bed, looking ruefully at a pair
of water-soaked white buckskin shoes. He
dropped them when he saw Dan and Alf, and cried
anxiously:</p>

<p>“How is he now?” Then he saw Dan’s white
face, faltered, and sank down heavily on the bed.
“He’s not—not dead?” he whispered.</p>

<p>“No, the doctor says he will be all right,” answered
Dan hurriedly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh! You looked so—so white that I was
afraid—”</p>

<p>“Why shouldn’t he look white?” demanded Alf
gruffly. “We heard you were both drowned, you
and Merrow. Some silly fool came over to the
gym and told us.”</p>

<p>“Me? Oh, I—I’m sorry,” answered Gerald
troubledly. “I didn’t know—”</p>

<p>“Well, you needn’t look so sad about it,” said
Dan, with a little laugh as he sat down. “All’s
well that ends well, but you certainly had us pretty
well scared. Look here, Gerald, how about your
father? Do you suppose he’s heard the yarn?”</p>

<p>“No.” Gerald reached over to the table and
looked at his watch. “He isn’t home yet. I was
going over there, but the doctor says I must go
to bed. I am kind of played out. We had to
paddle pretty fast coming back.”</p>

<p>“Who was with you?” asked Alf.</p>

<p>“Thompson. That was funny, wasn’t it? I
guess if he hadn’t come just when he did Harry
would have drowned.” He stopped and shivered.</p>

<p>“Here, you lie down there and pull the covers
over you,” said Dan. “You’d better go to sleep,
too.”</p>

<p>“No, I couldn’t go to sleep, really!” cried
Gerald. “I’d rather talk.” But he followed
Dan’s advice and snuggled down under a blanket.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>“How did it happen?” asked Alf. “I can’t
make heads nor tails of it.”</p>

<p>So Gerald told his story. Part of it we already
know. The rest Gerald told as follows:</p>

<p>“When I went down I kept my eyes open and
saw him almost at once. I thought he was
drowned already, for he didn’t seem to be struggling
at all, just lying down there in the mud on
top of a lot of sunken branches and rubbish. He
was only three or four yards from the bank, but
the pond is real deep there. There’s a sort of
channel where the water has cut along the side.
Well, I grabbed him by the shoulders and tried
to bring him up. He came about a foot and then
held. I pulled and tugged, but couldn’t raise him.
I stayed down until I thought my head was going
to burst open, and then I came up. And as I
got my head out of water and took a breath I
heard a splash and saw some one dive by me. It
was all terribly confused. I didn’t even wonder
who the other fellow was. I just filled up with
air and went down again. It was hard to see now,
for the water was all roiled up with mud and
sediment from the bottom, but I could make out
that the other fellow had his arms around Harry
and was pulling. So I got hold, too, and pulled,
and all of a sudden he came away in our arms, and
we came up with him and managed to get him up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
on the bank. Then I saw that the other fellow
was Thompson.”</p>

<p>“How did he happen to be there?” asked Dan.</p>

<p>“Just by accident. He was in his canoe by
himself, coming down the river, when he heard our
voices across on the lake, and thought he’d paddle
in and see who we were. Just before he got
through the channel he heard the splash when our
canoe dumped us out, and then he heard me yell.
He got there just as I dived, and he went over as
soon as he could.”</p>

<p>“Gee, that was—was—”</p>

<p>“Providential,” said Alf soberly, coming to
Dan’s assistance. “And then what, Gerald?”</p>

<p>“We tried everything we knew about helping
drowned persons, but nothing seemed to do much
good. We got a whole lot of water out of his
lungs, but he wouldn’t come to. We took turns
pumping his arms and chest, and after awhile we
could see that he was breathing. But it was
awfully hard, for there wasn’t much room on the
bank, and he kept slipping back into the water.
So Thompson said we’d put him into the canoe
and paddle back to school as fast as we could. So
finally we got him in and we grabbed the paddles
and we just made that canoe fly! It isn’t far, you
know, but it seemed an awful long way this afternoon.
I was afraid he’d die before we got to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
boathouse. We kept shouting all the way down
and finally some fellow heard us and came running
down to find out what the matter was. We told
him and he scooted up to the Office. We got him
out of the canoe at the boathouse and started to
work on him again. And then some fellows came
and helped, and I keeled over in a faint. And the
next thing I knew they were carrying Harry and
me up the hill. I was all right by that time, though,
and I made them put me down. Thompson and I
waited around a minute to see how Harry was,
but the doctor found us and gave us some stuff to
drink and sent us home. Said we must go to bed,
and not get up until to-morrow morning. That’s
nonsense, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Maybe,” said Dan dryly, “but I advise you to
do it just the same. You won’t feel so chipper
after you get over your excitement.”</p>

<p>“But what was the matter with Merrow?”
asked Alf. “Why didn’t he come up?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know for certain, but Thompson says
he was caught on a big branch down there.”</p>

<p>“But how did he happen to sink? Of course he
could swim.”</p>

<p>Gerald hesitated. Then:</p>

<p>“You fellows mustn’t tell Faculty,” he said,
“but I have an idea that he can’t swim a stroke.
He never actually told me he could, but he gave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
me to understand it. He said, I remember, that
Faculty wouldn’t let any one go in a canoe who
couldn’t swim. But afterwards, when we went
out together at first, he was awfully nervous if we
went more than a few yards from shore, and once
when I accidentally rocked the canoe a little, I
thought he was going to jump down my throat.
He got over that after awhile, though. I think
that when he went over he was so scared that he
just sort of—of fainted, maybe, and then got so
much water in him that he was down and out.”</p>

<p>“Your language, Gerald, is getting more picturesque
and breezy every day,” laughed Dan.</p>

<p>“I guess that was the way of it, though,” said
Alf. “The little fool! The idea of his paddling
around in a canoe and not knowing the first thing
about swimming. He ought to be—be spanked!”</p>

<p>“I guess when he gets around again he won’t
need any spanking to keep him away from canoes.
Canoes are pretty good fun, but fellows ought to
understand that they’re about as treacherous a
craft as there is made. And if I were you,”
added Dan, “I’d keep out of them awhile, too,
Gerald.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you worry,” was the reply. “I don’t
want to see one of them again for a year. Besides,
I guess my father will have something to
say, too.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>“I guess he will,” returned Dan grimly. “And
he may have something to say to me, too. I am
supposed to watch out for you, and I don’t seem
to have been doing it very well. He knew you
were going out in a canoe, didn’t he, Gerald?”</p>

<p>Gerald hesitated and colored.</p>

<p>“I—I don’t believe he did,” he answered
finally. “I never said anything to him about it.”</p>

<p>“You’re a wonder!” said Dan disgustedly.
“Supposing you’d been drowned to-day! A nice
pickle I’d have been in, wouldn’t I?”</p>

<p>“Well, I guess I’d have been in a nice pickle
myself,” replied Gerald spiritedly. “And it
seems to me I’d be worse off than you, Dan!”</p>

<p>“He’s got you there,” laughed Alf.</p>

<p>“Just the same,” said Dan with dignity, “you
haven’t played fair, Gerald, and you know it.
You’ve got to tell your father all about it the first
time you see him.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to,” answered Gerald gravely.
“Will you please telephone over after awhile,
Dan, and leave word for him to come over here
this evening and see me? I promised to go home
for dinner, and he will be worried if he doesn’t
hear. And—and you might say that I got wet
and was sent to bed.”</p>

<p>“All right,” answered Dan. “I’ll telephone.
Do you think—” there was an anxious tone in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
voice—“do you think he will be very angry with
you, Gerald?” Gerald smiled whimsically.</p>

<p>“I rather think he will, Dan. But I deserve
it. Don’t you trouble.”</p>

<p>Presently Alf remarked with a chuckle, as he
got up to go;</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose you’ll never be able to scrap
with Thompson now, Gerald. Another iridescent
dream gone glimmering. Such is life!”</p>

<p>“No,” answered Gerald thoughtfully. “I
guess we’re really square at last. If Harry had
been drowned—” He broke off with an eloquent
shake of his head. “Will you find out how he is
after supper, Dan, and let me know?”</p>

<p>“Yes. And now, what do you want to eat?”</p>

<p>“I’m not very hungry,” replied Gerald languidly.
“In fact, I think I’ll just—take a nap.”
He settled down on the pillow with a contented
smile and closed his eyes. Dan and Alf went out
quietly, and quietly closed the door behind them.</p>

<p>“He will probably sleep for an hour or two,”
said Alf. “We’d better tell them not to send his
supper up until seven. The poor kid might as
well have all the rest he can get.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Dan, “for he will probably need it.
I don’t think he will have a very pleasant time
explaining things to his father.”</p>

<p>“Think John T. will cut up rough, do you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, he’s awfully fond of Gerald, but—”</p>

<p>“<em>But!</em>” laughed Alf. Then, seriously: “Well,
I hope he won’t be too hard on little Geraldine.
He’s not a bad sort of a kid, Dan.”</p>

<small>THE LAST PRACTICE</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Dan didn’t hurry back to his room after supper,
nor, for that matter, did he hurry through the
meal. He and Lawrence were the last ones at
the training table. Dan always found the third
baseman’s conversation rather boresome, but this
evening, in his desire to kill time, he stood Lawrence
with equanimity, even egged him on to a
further elaboration of his subject, which might
have been entitled, “How I Would Train a Baseball
Team if I had the Chance.” Lawrence
wasn’t a bad sort of fellow; only a trifle self-assertive
when it came to opinions and lamentably
prosy in the presentation of them. To-night,
though, Dan was ready to forgive him much. He
had gone through five years at Yardley, each
Spring passing with honors, and in a few days
would receive his diploma. It was something of a
feat, when you came to think of it, Dan reflected,
and perhaps by the time he was ready to graduate
he might be a much bigger bore than Lawrence.</p>

<p>But presently the waiters were turning out the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
lights over the tables here and there, and there
was no excuse for further loitering. Gerald’s
supper had gone over to him long before. Dan
pushed back his chair, and Lawrence, still rambling
on, followed him. Out in the corridor Lawrence
suggested that Dan should come up to his
room for a few minutes; he lived on the floor
above. Dan hesitated, and then, because he was
very anxious to give Mr. Pennimore plenty of time
to finish his visit with Gerald and go home, he accepted
the invitation. He had never visited Lawrence
before and the comfort, even luxury of the
big square room surprised him. Lawrence made
him take the biggest and easiest chair, and then
went on with his views. Dan nodded now and
then, now and then pretended to question an assertion,
and all the time was wondering whether
it was safe to go back to his own room. After
a while some other fellows came in, and Dan seized
the opportunity to leave. Lawrence informed the
newcomers warmly that “that chap Vinton is a
mighty brainy youngster.”</p>

<p>Dan looked at his watch as he climbed the stairs
in Clarke, and found that the time was a quarter
to nine. That was comforting. Gerald’s father
must have returned to Sound View before this.
It was a relief not to have to face Mr. Pennimore
just now. Dan felt very culpable regarding the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
canoe episode. He owed a good deal to Mr. Pennimore,
and he had promised to look after Gerald.
Just how to reconcile that promise with the fact
that Gerald had been canoeing for a month past
without his father’s permission was somewhat of
a puzzle. When Dan reached the door of Number
28 his heart sank. He had returned too early,
after all!</p>

<p>Gerald was still in bed, and it was not difficult
to see that he had been crying. But at present
he was looking quite happy, as was Mr. Pennimore,
seated beside him. However severe the storm
had been, reflected Dan, it had cleared away now.
He greeted Mr. Pennimore and shook hands without
discerning any signs of reproach nor condemnation
in the other’s regard. Mr. Pennimore
referred briefly and smilingly to the accident,
asked for news of Harry Merrow, and expressed
his pleasure when Dan assured him that Harry
was practically recovered after his narrow escape.</p>

<p>“He heard me at the door,” said Dan, “and
asked to see me. But the matron thought I’d
better not go in. He sent word that you were to
come and see him in the morning, Gerald.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” said Mr. Pennimore. “And I’ll
send Higgins over after breakfast with some fruit,
Gerald. He will probably like it. You can take
it around to him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>“And please have him bring me my stamp
books, all three of them. They’re in my room.
Elizabeth knows where they are. I’m going to
give them to Harry.”</p>

<p>Mr. Pennimore raised his brows slightly.</p>

<p>“Just as you like, son, but you mustn’t forget
that you’ve got a thousand dollars or so worth of
stamps there. Rather an expensive present, isn’t
it?”</p>

<p>“I don’t care for them any more,” replied
Gerald. “And Harry does. I’d rather some one
would have them who can enjoy them.”</p>

<p>“I dare say you’re right, son. I’ll send them
over. And now shall we ask Dan about Friday?”</p>

<p>Gerald nodded eagerly.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Mr. Pennimore, “Gerald tells me
that on Friday the Baseball Team doesn’t have
any practice, and that he understands it to be the
custom to give them a sort of a good time to keep
their minds off the next day’s game. How about
that, Dan?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, they usually take them for a walk
into the country or load them onto a trolley car in
Greenburg and give them a ride. I haven’t heard
what they are going to do with us this year.”</p>

<p>“Well, now, Gerald proposes that I put the
Princess at their disposal Friday afternoon, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
let them have a nice, long sail. How do you think
that would do?”</p>

<p>“Bully!” cried Dan. “They’d enjoy that, I
know, sir.”</p>

<p>“I tried to persuade Gerald to look after the
matter, but he doesn’t seem to think he ought to.
Says, too, that he won’t go along, because he’s
not on the nine. I tell him he ought to go and act
as host, but he doesn’t see it.”</p>

<p>“Dan will understand,” said Gerald confidently.
“I couldn’t exactly explain to father, Dan, but I
know I’m right.” Dan nodded.</p>

<p>“Yes, I think you are. It’s rather difficult to
explain, sir, but Gerald has the right idea.” Mr.
Pennimore smiled and spread his hands.</p>

<p>“I suppose it’s a matter of school ethics, eh?”
he asked. “Well, have your own way. Now, can
you see the coach or the captain and tell him about
this, Dan?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, I’ll see Millener, and say you’ve made
the offer and that he’s to talk with you about it.”</p>

<p>“He can call me up on the telephone, if he likes,
any time to-morrow before eight or after six. I
shall be glad to have them use the yacht. I’d like
to go along—if it wouldn’t infringe some mysterious
law—but I shall have to be in the city Friday
if I’m to take a holiday on Saturday.”</p>

<p>“Then you’ll want the yacht, sir,” said Dan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, no, I’ll use the train for once. Well, I’ll
leave the matter in your hands for the present.
And see that this boy stays in bed the rest of the
evening, Dan. Now, I must be getting back.” At
the door he laid a hand on Dan’s shoulder.
“Gerald and I, by the way, have been discussing
canoes, Dan, and we’ve decided that they’re a bit
too dangerous for young boys. Good night, good
night! You’re to come over to dinner Sunday,
Dan. Or—” Mr. Pennimore paused, smiled, and
turned back into the room. “Look here, Gerald,
how would you like to entertain the Baseball Team
at dinner Sunday, eh?”</p>

<p>Gerald sat up eagerly.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t do it, sir, but you could! Will you?
That would be just dandy, wouldn’t it, Dan?”</p>

<p>“Fine!” said Dan enthusiastically. “But
there’s an awful lot of them, sir.”</p>

<p>“How many?”</p>

<p>“Pretty near twenty.”</p>

<p>“Pshaw, we can handle thirty if we can find
them! The more the merrier, boys! I guess
after the sort of training table food you told me
about the other day, Dan, they’ll relish a change,
eh? I’ll tell the cook to plan all the sweet, indigestible
things he can think of—and pile on the
whipped cream! We won’t say anything about this
yet. I’ll see Doctor Hewitt and talk it over with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
him first. Good night, son. Get a good long
sleep. Good night, Dan.”</p>

<p>Dan went with Mr. Pennimore to the stairs, and
then returned to Gerald, and an excited discussion
of the sailing party and the Sunday banquet.</p>

<p>The next morning Gerald was up bright and
early, feeling no ill effects from the previous
day’s misadventure. He soon found that he was
looked on as something of a hero, and had he responded
to all the requests for his story of the
incident, he would never have reached commons
in time for breakfast. When he did give his account
of the upset, as he was forced to do at table,
he gave most of the credit to Thompson.</p>

<p>“Shucks!” said one of his audience, “you and
Thompson make me tired. He says you did it
all and you say he did. I’ll bet a dollar Merrow
crawled out of the water himself, while you two
fellows were wrangling about who was to be the
hero!”</p>

<p>To-day was the last day of examinations, and
Gerald’s work was over early. At half-past ten
he set out for Merle Hall with his arms full. He
carried a big basket of fruit from the Sound View
hot houses, and the three big stamp books. He
found Harry still rather pale and scared looking,
but eager to show his gratitude and anxious to
talk. Being thanked for saving a fellow’s life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
was, Gerald found, rather embarrassing, and he
switched Harry away from that subject as soon
as he could by producing the basket and the
books.</p>

<p>“These are the ones I told you about yesterday,”
he explained of the books, when Harry had
admired and nibbled at the fruit. “You know I
was going to give them to you in case Broadwood
won the game. But I want you to have them anyhow.
So—so here they are.”</p>

<p>But Harry, much as he wanted them, required
a good deal of persuasion before he would accept
them. And then it was only with the proviso that
Gerald was to have them back any time he changed
his mind. Then Gerald exhibited some of the
rarer treasures, and the two boys were deeply absorbed
when there was a knock on the door, and
Arthur Thompson entered.</p>

<p>“Thought I’d just drop in and see how you
are,” he explained, shaking hands with Harry in
an embarrassed way. He, too, had to listen to
Harry’s thanks, and by this time Harry was quite
an experienced hand at expressing gratitude, and
seemed to thoroughly enjoy his privilege.
Thompson sat through it as patiently as possible,
casting sheepish glances the while at Gerald.
Afterwards they went over the adventure together,
each one describing his sensations and explaining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
his actions, and then Gerald got up to
leave.</p>

<p>“I must go, too,” said Thompson hurriedly.
“Get well, Merrow, and—er—buck up, you know.”</p>

<p>Gerald promised to look in again in the evening
and then he and Thompson withdrew. Gerald
expected the latter to leave him at the entrance,
but instead of that Thompson kept step with him
down the walk toward Clarke. Gerald strove to
think of something to say, but without success,
and the silence was growing rather embarrassing,
when Thompson broke out with:</p>

<p>“Say, Pennimore, what have you got against
me, anyway? If it’s that little row we had last
Winter, why, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean any harm,
really.”</p>

<p>“I guess I haven’t got anything against you—after
yesterday,” replied Gerald gravely.</p>

<p>“That’s the way to talk!” said Thompson,
clapping him on the shoulder. “I’ve noticed that
you didn’t see me when we passed, and I don’t like
that. I don’t like fellows to be stand-offish with
me. I haven’t anything against you, and so—”</p>

<p>“If you haven’t anything against me,” blurted
Gerald, “why did you keep me out of Cambridge?”</p>

<p>“Keep you out of Cambridge? Me? I never
did!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, get out!” scoffed Gerald warmly.</p>

<p>“Honest, I didn’t, Pennimore. Look here, I
haven’t any right to tell you this, but—but if I
don’t you won’t believe me, I guess. It was Jake
Hiltz that blackballed you.”</p>

<p>“Hiltz? I don’t know him even by sight,” exclaimed
Gerald perplexedly. Thompson nodded.</p>

<p>“I know, but he knows you. You see, Hiltz and
a fellow named Jones, Tubby Jones we called him,
were pretty good friends. Jones used to room
with Vinton in the Fall.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Gerald. “I knew him.”</p>

<p>“Well, Tubby, you know, left school before the
term was up; got fired or something; no one ever
knew exactly what did happen to Tubby. Then
you came to room with Vinton, and Hiltz—well,
Hiltz resented it. That’s all. He just didn’t like
to see you in Tubby’s place. And, besides that,
he doesn’t like Vinton much, I think. And, anyway,
he’s the sort of chap that would rather spite
some one, if he could do it without being found
out, than eat his dinner. I hadn’t any business
telling you this, Pennimore, because we’re not
supposed to tell anything that happens at election,
but I didn’t want you to think I’d done any such
dirty trick. And you would have thought so, even
if I’d argued myself black in the face, wouldn’t
you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, I think I would,” answered Gerald
frankly. Thompson laughed.</p>

<p>“I’ll bet you would. You believe what I say,
though, now, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed. And—and I’m glad I was mistaken.”</p>

<p>“That’s the talk!” returned Thompson heartily.
“I don’t see any use in fellows having grouches
with each other. I like plenty of friends. I guess
I’m pretty mean sometimes, but I’m always ready
to apologize and shake hands. Let’s do that now;
what do you say?”</p>

<p>“All right,” answered Gerald with a smile.
And so they shook hands on the steps of Clarke,
and Thompson went off, beaming and whistling at
the top of his lungs.</p>

<p>There was a hard practice that afternoon, delayed
by the thunder-storm. Payson was himself
again, and the way he drove and scolded was a
caution. But the fellows liked it and responded
magnificently. It was almost six o’clock when he
finally released them. Afterwards, in the locker
room, he made a little speech.</p>

<p>“If you play on Saturday the way you played
to-day,” he said, “you’ll stand a mighty good
show to win. I’ve let you fellows go your own
gait since last Saturday, because I saw that you
were a bit fine, and I didn’t think you’d stand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
driving. I argued that if you really wanted to
win from Broadwood, you’d work out your own
salvation, and you’ve done it. I guess some of
you have been calling me names.”</p>

<p>A good many of his hearers looked sheepish.
Payson smiled grimly.</p>

<p>“That’s all right. I can’t blame you. I dare
say it looked as though I had paresis. I hadn’t,
though. I simply gave you fellows credit for
some sense and fight, and I wasn’t mistaken. The
way you got together and played the game just
to <em>show</em> me, proves that. Well, we’ve had the
last practice for this year, and I’ve taught you all
I could. It’s up to you now. I can’t do any
more. You’ve pulled together well, and you’ve
pulled with me well. You’ve got a fine captain,
and it will be your own faults if he doesn’t lead
a winning team. To-morrow afternoon we’re going
to take an outing. Mr. John T. Pennimore
has offered us the use of his steam yacht for the
whole afternoon, and Captain Millener has accepted
with thanks. I want every fellow to go
along. You’re to meet at Mr. Pennimore’s pier at
two o’clock. I guess you’ll have a good time.
Whether you do or don’t, an afternoon on the
water will do you all good. Don’t bother your
heads about Saturday’s game—yet. Plenty of
time for thinking about that when Saturday<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
comes. Broadwood has a slight advantage this
year in playing on her own grounds, but we can
offset that if we try. To-morrow at two o’clock,
then.”</p>

<p>“Now, fellows, three cheers for Mr. Payson!”
cried Millener, jumping onto a bench. And they
were given royally. And then came three cheers
for Mr. Pennimore, which would have done
Gerald’s heart good had he been there to hear.</p>

<p>Gerald saw the baseball team, accompanied by
Payson and Andy Ryan, embark on the Princess
the next day with regret. He didn’t regret that
Dan and Alf and Millener and Colton, and all the
other baseball fellows he knew by sight and duly
reverenced, were going to have a jolly afternoon
together; he only regretted that he wasn’t along;
and he regretted that a whole lot. But Gerald
had been learning during the last six months.
When he first entered Yardley he would have accompanied
the team to-day without a qualm, and
would have wondered why the fellows treated him
coolly. Now he knew that some of the fellows
would call him “fresh kid,” and almost all would
hold him in contempt for showing off. So he
watched the embarking from the terrace of Sound
View, and afterward went up to the gymnasium,
got into his dark blue gym suit, and went at the
punching-bag until he was breathless, cheerful,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
and running with perspiration. Then he trotted
down to the bath and whistled happily while the
luke-warm spray enveloped his grateful body.
He was quite alone down there and could make
as much noise as he wanted to. At last, bracing
himself for the shock, he “turned on the ice,” as
the fellows said, and yelled lustily as the cold jets
hissed upon him. Then, glowing and refreshed,
puffing and gasping, he rubbed himself dry and
dressed leisurely, whistling merrily all the while,
from stockings to tie. Finally he climbed the
stairs again, paused at the door in the warm
afternoon sunlight to cock his straw hat a trifle
over one eye in the approved Yardley fashion,
and then took the path to the tennis courts in
search of adventure with the little swagger engendered
by mental and physical exhilaration.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV</a><br />
<small>ON YARDLEY HILL</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Although Yardley Hall is less than forty years
old, it has its customs and precedents. And one
of them is that on the evening preceding the
Broadwood game the combined musical clubs of
Cambridge and Oxford shall give a concert in the
Yard. At half-past seven the performers gathered
in front of Dudley and the audience distributed
itself on the grass or sat at the open
windows facing the Yard. It was still light up
here on the hill, although below the shadows were
darkening over river and marsh and meadow.
Gerald and Harry, the latter up and about in a
borrowed dressing-gown, sat by the open window
which looked directly across at Dudley. The
mandolins, banjos, and guitars set the fellows
humming and whistling with “The Merry Widow
Waltzes” and one or two older favorites, and
then the glee clubs hummed the accompaniment
and Wheelock, substitute fielder on the Nine, sang
“Mighty Lak’ a Rose,” his sweet tenor voice filling
the silent Yard with its mellow tones. Such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
an outburst of hand-clapping and applauding
voices rewarded this that he was forced to sing
the song over again and follow it with “A Health
to King Charles.” Then the musicians started
in on “Old Yardley,” and in a moment every fellow
was singing lustily, in tune or out, according
to his ability. Up from the grass and down from
the crowded windows were hurled the defiant
strains;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Old Yardley can’t be beat, my boy,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">She’s bound to win the game!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">So give a cheer for Yardley and<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Hats off to Yardley’s fame!”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>That started the cheering. They cheered for
Captain Millener, for Colton, for Loring and so on
down to Payson and Andy Ryan and “the subs,”
the fellows gradually gathering above the leader
who had mounted the steps of Dudley. Then
they cheered for “Yardley! <em>Yardley!</em> <span class="smcap">Yardley!</span>”
over and over. Afterwards Millener made a short
speech, and was followed by Payson. There were
more cheers and finally the glee clubs started
“The Years Roll On.” Off came hats and in
the soft, summer twilight the slow, sweet, and
solemn melody rose to the darkening sky.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“The years roll on. Too soon we find<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Our boyhood days are o’er.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The scenes we’ve known, the friends we’ve loved,<br /></span>

<span class="i1">But in the shrine of Memory<br /></span>
<span class="i3">We’ll hold and cherish still<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The recollection fond of those<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Dear days on Yardley Hill.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“The years roll on. To man’s estate<br /></span>
<span class="i3">From youthful mould we pass,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And Life’s stern duties bind us round,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>It is hard to hear that song unmoved if you are
a Yardley man, and the group in front of Dudley
dissolved silently, by ones and twos and by little
groups, the fellows seeking their rooms or their
friends’ rooms to sit at the open windows and talk
of graduation, or the morrow’s contest, or the
long summer vacation which was almost upon
them.</p>

<p>Dan and Tom and Alf had listened to the concert
from the window of Number 7, and after the
last strain of the final song had died away they
sat there in silence and watched the crowd break
up and the fellows radiate across the Yard in
the dusk. Finally Alf gave an impatient shake
of his shoulders.</p>

<p>“Hang that song, anyhow,” he said, half laughing,
half in earnest. “It always makes me feel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
so kind of teary and noble. If I was a millionaire
I’d go out and give away my money. Let’s sing
‘Harrigan’ or something lively.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think it’s going to hurt you, Alf, to
feel noble for once,” drawled Tom.</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” answered Alf, “but I tell
you right now that if they sing that next year,
just before I’m going to graduate, I’ll disgrace
you and myself and the Class by boo-hooing; I’m
just certain I will!”</p>

<p>“Don’t trouble,” said Tom soothingly. “It
isn’t likely that you’ll ever graduate.”</p>

<p>Saturday was a “scorcher.” It started right
out being a “scorcher”; even as early as seven
o’clock you knew mighty well just what you were
in for. At breakfast Dan turned in disgust from
the hot cereal and had difficulty getting rid of
the three-inch-square piece of steak and a small
portion of the enormous baked potato that was
set before him. The coffee scalded his throat and
made him hotter still. Over at the other table,
where sat the “regulars,” Payson was expostulating
with Danforth, the second baseman.</p>

<p>“You must eat something, Danforth. You’ll
be knocked up for all day if you don’t. At least
put that glass of milk down and eat a roll.”</p>

<p>“I really can’t, sir,” Dan heard the boy answer.
“I’ve had one glass already, and that’s all I want.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
If I eat now I won’t be able to take any luncheon.
It’s so hot!”</p>

<p>“All right, but if you feel shaky towards
eleven you come here and make them give you
something; don’t wait for luncheon. Now then,
fellows, I want every one of you to stay out of
doors and loaf. No tennis to-day, no golf, no
anything but loafing. Luncheon’s at twelve-thirty,
remember, and the barges leave at one.
So you want to be right on time when the doors
open.”</p>

<p>“How about the river, sir?” someone asked.
“Can we row or paddle?”</p>

<p>“I guess so, if you don’t do too much of it.
But keep out of the sun all you can. That means
you, too, you fellows,” he added, turning to the
second table. “Keep out of doors, keep out of
the sun, and keep quiet. Luncheon at half-past
twelve.”</p>

<p>It was hard work getting rid of that morning.
There were no lessons to learn, no recitations to
attend, no examinations to tussle with. Dan and
Alf found a shady spot at the edge of the woods
and tried to read, but it was stifling hot, even
there, and the books soon slipped out of their
hands. Here Gerald found them after a while and
Alf returned to a semblance of animation while
he teased Gerald about the dinner party. It had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
been all arranged and the news was about school.
Alf pretended that it was Gerald who was to give
it and was vastly concerned about the cost.</p>

<p>At eleven Gerald left them to hurry down to
Sound View and make the butler’s life a burden
until the early luncheon was ready. Afterwards,
when it was still only a few minutes past one,
the automobile rolled around to the front door
and Gerald and his father got in and sped up the
hill to Merle Hall, where they took in Harry, officially
pronounced well enough to see the game.
Then, with flags flying, for Gerald had adorned
the car with four Yardley banners, they sped off
down the hill, across the bridge and away along
the dusty road to Broadwood. They passed the
barges half way over and received a cheer as they
swept past. Gerald thought he had caught a
brief glimpse of Dan in the second barge, but
wasn’t certain. At all events, Dan was there
and supremely happy. For at luncheon Payson
had called across to him from the other table;</p>

<p>“Careful with your eating, Vinton. Don’t
stuff. Danforth’s knocked out and you’ll start
the game at second.”</p>

<p>It was all very well to feel confident of a victory
for the Blue when you were back there in Yardley
with the Yardley cheers ringing in your ears, but
it was rather more difficult now, when almost
every person waved a Broadwood flag or wore a
knot of green and when one was literally within
the enemy’s camp. This was the thought that
came to Gerald as he followed his father and
Harry while they worked their way through the
crowd about the tiny grand-stand and finally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
found seats on that structure. Accommodations
there were at a premium, for the stand afforded
the only shade about the diamond and was so
small that only Faculty members, parents, friends,
and students accompanying them were admitted.
The rest of the spectators lined the field behind
the ropes stretched along the first and third base
lines, or perched themselves upon the roof and
in the windows of the laboratory building which
stood nearby. Broadwood’s field adjoined the
campus, and from the stand one could look down
a long slope of meadow and farm land for almost
a mile.</p>

<p>Gerald confided his doubts to Harry when they
had finally squeezed themselves into their seats
high up under the sloping roof, but Harry had
of a sudden changed from a pessimist to an optimist
regarding Yardley’s chances.</p>

<p>“Don’t you worry,” he replied excitedly.
“We’ll trim ’em for fair. Here comes Yardley
now!”</p>

<p>The blue-stockinged team, some twenty strong,
came trotting down from the gymnasium, pushed
through the crowd about the ropes, hurdled over
or ducked under them, and went to their bench
at the right of the plate. The bench, with its
little strip of gay awning above, was in full view
of the stand and Gerald and Harry amused themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
with comments on the appearances of the
players.</p>

<p>“There’s Millener,” said Harry. “Doesn’t he
look great in his uniform?” Gerald admitted
that he did, but insisted that Colton looked finer.</p>

<p>“Look at Danforth!” said Gerald a moment
later. “He hasn’t got his uniform on! I’ll bet
he isn’t going to play!”</p>

<p>“He’s sick, that’s what’s the matter with him,”
responded Harry bitterly. “Look at him. He
looks like a sheet of paper. Isn’t that the toughest
luck you ever saw? Why, he’s one of our
best players; we haven’t got anyone else can play
second like Danforth!”</p>

<p>“Who’ll they use?” asked Gerald anxiously.</p>

<p>“Tufts, I guess; he’s the regular sub. But he
isn’t any good. We’ll find out in a minute,
though, for they’re going out to practice.” Gerald
turned to acquaint his father with the heart-breaking
news, but Mr. Pennimore had discovered
an acquaintance in the lady at his other side and
was busily engaged in conversation. Then the
team trotted out for practice, and Gerald, discovering
Dan amongst the players, held his breath
until the youth had taken his position at second.
Then he turned radiantly to Harry. But Harry
had seen for himself, and their exclamations of
wonderment and delight exploded together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span></p>

<p>“Dan,” cried Gerald.</p>

<p>“Vinton!” cried Harry.</p>

<p>For the next few minutes they excitedly discussed
this new development in all its phases.
Mr. Pennimore was informed and expressed the
proper degree of pleasure and excitement. But
he made a terrible mistake the next moment when
he inquired whether anyone had made a run yet.
Gerald sat on him properly, informing him that
the game hadn’t begun. Then Broadwood came
onto the field and the cheers drowned conversation
for a full minute. Yardley retired to the
bench and Gerald and Harry watched the rival
team’s practice with critical eyes. But they were
forced to acknowledge that “Broadwood certainly
could field,” and that if the Green played that
way in the game, Yardley would have hard work
winning. At last, at half-past two, the umpire
called the captains to him, Millener of Yardley
and Gale of Broadwood, and there was a minute’s
conference at the plate. Then Gale turned to the
bench and raised his hand.</p>

<p>“On the run, fellows!” he called.</p>

<p>Broadwood took the field and Gerald and Harry
examined the Blue’s pitcher with interest as he
began throwing into the catcher’s mitt to limber
up. He was as tall as Colton, but slenderer, had
dark hair and a rather surly expression about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
his mouth except when he smiled. His movements,
save when actually pitching, were deliberate
to a degree.</p>

<p>“He doesn’t look much,” confided Gerald.</p>

<p>“But you wait and see,” muttered Harry.
“He’s all right. Here comes Durfee to bat. I
say! They’ve gone and changed the batting
order, haven’t they?”</p>

<p>“Probably because Danforth’s out,” suggested
Gerald wisely. “Seems to me it’s a good scheme
to have Durfee bat first, because if he does get
to first he’s pretty sure to steal safely.”</p>

<p>Little Durfee, the Yardley shortstop, spread
his legs, gripped his bat and faced the pitcher.</p>

<p>“Play ball!” said the umpire.</p>

<p>And the “Big Game” was on.</p>

<p>A moment later the Yardley partisans were
leaping and shouting for joy. Durfee bunted
past Herring and the pitcher fielded too late.
Durfee was credited with a hit, but with a quicker
man in the box he would never have reached first
safely. But he was there, very much there, and
that was enough for the wavers of the blue flags.
Then came Colton, and there were cries of “Home
run, Colton! Hit it out!” And in the outfield
the players stepped back, for Colton’s reputation
was well known. With two balls and one strike
on him, Colton raised his bat in front of a waist-high<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
ball and sent it rolling slowly toward third.
Third baseman and pitcher both made for it, but
it was a clean hit this time and Durfee was safe
at second and Colton at first. How Yardley did
shriek and yell!</p>

<p>“Well, I guess that’ll do for a starter!”
shrieked Smith, coaching back of first. “I guess
that’s going some! On your toes, now! Down
with his arm!”</p>

<p>Herring, plainly worried, tried to throw Colton
out at first, but Smith laughed derisively and Colton
climbed to his feet again, dusted the front of
his clothes and edged again into a lead. Herring
scowled, glanced around at Durfee, who was dancing
back and forth at second, and settled down
to the next man, Condit. Evidently Condit
thought that what had served twice would serve
again, or maybe he had his orders from the bench.
At all events, he, too, bunted. The ball rolled
toward the pitcher’s box as straight as an arrow
and Herring scooped it up. But he was rattled,
threw hurriedly and the ball instead of reaching
first baseman’s hands landed on Condit’s shoulder
and glanced away under the rope. Little Durfee
raced home, Colton went to third and Condit took
second.</p>

<p>The Yardley cheers were deafening. Gerald
and Harry pounded each other on the back and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
shrieked into each other’s ears, and even Mr.
Pennimore was excited and kept saying “Good!
Good! Good!” over and over in a voice that, owing
to the noise about him, no one could possibly
hear. Patterson, Broadwood’s catcher, held
a consultation with Herring midway between
box and plate, and everyone knew that he was
trying to steady the pitcher down. That his efforts
were successful was proved a minute later
when Lawrence hit a ball into Herring’s territory
and was thrown out neatly. However, that
was only one out and Yardley was still delirious
with joy.</p>

<p>Alf Loring was up next and he, like Colton, was
enthusiastically advised to “Lam it out for a
homer!” “Knock the cover off it, Alf!” He
didn’t quite do that, but he managed to find one
to his liking and singled to center, scoring Colton
and Condit. Alf himself, however, went out trying
to make second, and when Richards struck out
miserably a few minutes later, the side was out
and Broadwood was so relieved that she cheered
long and loudly. Yardley let her cheer. With
three runs already to her credit she could afford
to be indulgent.</p>

<p>For Broadwood, Cross, second baseman, was
the first man up. Colton’s first ball went wild
and took Mr. Cross squarely in the ribs, dropping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
him where he stood, but not incapacitating him
from hobbling to first a moment afterwards. So
apparently painful was his progress down the
line that Yardley men forbore to jeer and a murmur
of sympathy arose from the feminine onlookers.
Colton looked quite remorseful for a moment,
but for a moment only. For just as soon
as he had transferred his regard from Cross to
the man at the bat, Cross, disabilities and all,
streaked down to second, making one of the prettiest
steals of the day and awakening peals of
laughter from friend and foe alike. Dan ran to
the base to cover, but Richards was taken so
wholly by surprise that he didn’t even make the
motion to throw down. Colton looked disgusted,
tried to catch Cross napping, and turned his attention
resolutely to the batsman. But Colton
hadn’t found himself yet; that was apparent to
everyone. With two balls and two strikes on the
batsman he was unable to please the umpire and
Captain Gale walked to first.</p>

<p>The next man came to bat and swung at a wide
one and an attempt at a double steal was made.
Cross, however, was out on a fast throw from
catcher to third and it was a close decision that
called Gale safe on second, so rapidly did the ball
fly about. Such snappy work deserved applause
and received it. The batsman made the second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
out, Colton to Millener, and right-fielder Boudinot,
who followed him, fell a victim to Colton’s deceptive
curves and canny change of speed. So
ended the first inning, the score 3 to 0 and Yardley
well pleased and confident of the outcome.</p>

<p>Dan’s first chance at the willow came in the
next inning, after Millener, first man up, had hit
a hard liner that first baseman was unable to
handle. I wish I could say that Dan faced the
enemy’s pitcher unflinchingly and drove out a
three-bagger. But truth compels me to narrate
the fact that Dan did nothing of the sort. It was
his first appearance in a big game and he was
distinctly nervous; and Herring and Patterson
saw it and simply toyed with him. He aided in
his own defeat by knocking two flies in succession,
and then reached out for a wide ball and walked
dejectedly back to the bench. He found the whole
team smiling, not maliciously, but with a sort of
“We’ve-all-been-there” expression that was
rather comforting to him and helped him hold
his head up again.</p>

<p>“You’ll do better next time,” muttered Alf,
clapping him on the knee. “Just don’t let him
scare you, Dan.”</p>

<p>Smith, who followed Dan at the bat, hit to
Broadwood’s second baseman and a neat double
play retired the side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>

<p>When Broadwood came up Colton was master
of the situation and retired her in one, two, three
order.</p>

<p>The first of the third found the head of the
Yardley batting list up. Yardley cheers broke
forth encouragingly as little Durfee selected his
bat and strode to the plate. But a foul which
settled with a <em>smack</em> into Patterson’s mitt spoiled
his career at the outset. When, however, Colton
smashed out a two-bagger over shortstop’s head,
things looked rosy again. But Colton was too
ambitious and was an easy out in trying to steal
third. Condit popped an infield fly. Again
Broadwood fell victim to Colton.</p>

<p>In the fourth inning Loring followed Colton’s
example and got two bases on a drive into left
field. Unfortunately he followed the pitcher’s example
too closely and, like him, was put out trying
to steal third.</p>

<p>Broadwood had a streak of luck in her half.
With one down, Russell was hit by Colton and
went to first. Boudinot then took advantage of
Colton’s moment of upset and landed on an easy
ball and sent it arching into center field. Out
there there was a mix-up and Smith and Lawrence,
each trying for the catch, collided and the
ball fell to earth, leaving Russell on second and
Boudinot on first. With only one man out, Kent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
sacrificed and advanced the runners. Broadwood
was cheering imploringly for runs. Patterson,
her catcher, looked wicked as he faced Colton.
Colton settled down and pitched carefully, but
Patterson was not to be denied. There was a
sharp <em>crack</em> and away went the ball far over center-fielder’s
head. That hit was good for three
bases, and Russell and Boudinot scored.</p>

<p>Broadwood went crazy with joy and the green
banners waved tumultuously. Up on the grand
stand, Mr. Pennimore, Gerald, and Harry unanimously
agreed that “it was perfectly rotten.”
There was still a man on third and Broadwood
kept up her cheering as Bray, her big first baseman,
took his place at the plate. But Bray was
far too eager to hit and Colton disposed of him
easily.</p>

<p>With the score 3 to 2 in Yardley’s favor the
game went on without further scoring until the
sixth inning. Anyone not owning allegiance to
Blue or Green would probably have voted the
next inning and a half quite uninteresting. But
to the audience it was all breathlessly exciting.
Every move in the game was closely watched,
every moment had its thrill. Dan faced the redoubtable
Herring again in the fifth, and, although
he was not so nervous this time, he again
failed to connect with the ball. In the first of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
the sixth Yardley got a man as far as second, but
no further.</p>

<p>When Broadwood came to bat in their half of
this inning it was seen that the first man up was
a new player. His name was Little and he had
taken Russell’s place in center field. Broadwood
cheered expectantly when he stepped to the plate.
Evidently he had a reputation as a hitter. If
he had, he fully lived up to it, for he found the
second ball offered and sent it over Lawrence’s
head for a home-run, tying the score and throwing
Broadwood adherents into a veritable delirium
of delight.</p>

<p>“Why didn’t Lawrence play further out?”
demanded Harry angrily. “I saw Millener wave
to him. I’ll bet that run will lose us the
game!”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t look as easy as it did after the first
inning, does it?” asked Gerald dubiously.
“Still, we’ve got just as good a show as they
have.”</p>

<p>“No, we haven’t. They’re beginning to find
Colton now. They’ll start in and knock him all
over the place, I’ll bet! You just wait and see!”
Harry’s tones were so lugubrious that Mr. Pennimore
thought he ought to cheer him up. So he
remarked pleasantly:</p>

<p>“Well, well, that was a fine hit, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>

<p>The remark was received with silent disgust.</p>

<p>Amidst renewed cheering from Broadwood,
Boudinot stepped to the plate and gripped his
bat.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span></p>




<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI</a><br />
<small>DOUBLE PLAY</small></h2>
</div>


<p>But Harry’s dismal prophecy was not, for the
time at least, to come true. Colton steadied down
magnificently and Boudinot, Kent and Patterson
were easy victims. A sigh of relief swept over
the Yardley ranks as the last men went out.
Fortune still smiled impartially upon the Blue
and the Green alike, and there were still three
innings to be contested.</p>

<p>A little breeze came along the hillside and
brought a measure of relief to the perspiring
players and spectators. The sun was almost two
hours nearer the horizon.</p>

<p>In the first of the seventh Yardley again got
men on bases, and with two out and men on first
and second, Dan went to bat. As he picked out
his bat he looked inquiringly at Payson, but the
coach shook his head. “Do the best you can,”
he said simply. Dan’s best wasn’t good enough.
It was an easy hit into second baseman’s glove.
Secretly, however, he was encouraged, and entertained
hopes of being able to get a safe hit off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
the Blue’s pitcher before the game was over.
That hope wasn’t realized, but it comforted Dan
at the time.</p>

<p>Colton pitched wonderful ball in the seventh
and eighth, and Broadwood could do nothing with
him, although in the eighth an error on the part
of Condit at third put a man safe on first, and a
poor throw to second by Richards later gave the
same runner another base. But he didn’t get beyond
the second bag.</p>

<p>The ninth inning opened with Lawrence at bat
for the Blue. Yardley had congregated her
cheering forces back of third base and was whooping
things up in great style. The time had come
for a rally and the School at large meant to do
all it could to bring it about. The blue-stockinged
players themselves brightened up and
looked more determined. Up in the grand-stand
Gerald and Harry were leaning forward on the
edge of the seat and breathing hard. Mr. Pennimore
had lighted a cigar. As he was an infrequent
smoker, Gerald knew that the cigar was to
quiet his father’s nerves.</p>

<p>Lawrence came to bat, looking fiercely determined,
and after he had struck four fouls hit
the ball into first baseman’s hands. A poor beginning,
that. But the cheerers seemed undismayed
and when Loring followed him they gave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
him a cheer that was a cheer, a cheer with three
“Lorings” on the end.</p>

<p>Alf had been batting finely and great things
were expected of him. Just what he would have
accomplished will never be known, for an in-shoot
struck him on the wrist and he walked to first
nursing the injured member and scowling fearsomely
at Herring. Herring, however, was probably
quite as regretful over the occurrence as Alf.
Once on the bag Alf recovered his good temper
and, just to prove that all was forgiven, immediately
stole second amidst the wild plaudits of his
friends. He made a fine slide and beat the ball
by what looked to be about a half-inch, but which
was probably somewhat more. Richards, looking
just as grimly determined as Lawrence,
singled between shortstop and third baseman, and
Alf went on to third. He would have kept on for
home, and might possibly have made it, had not
Colton, coaching behind that base, held him. Colton
came in for a good deal of criticism, but with
only one out, he played it safely and wisely.</p>

<p>Millener went to bat with Alf on third and Richards
on first. Richards was not a good man at
stealing and Durfee, who was coaching at first,
held him there and awaited a hit. Millener was
anxious enough to hit, too; you could see that.
But nothing came to his liking. Perhaps the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
cross-fire of coaching got on Herring’s nerves.
At all events, after scoring two strikes on Millener
he was unable to put another ball over, and Millener
trotted to first on four balls. That filled
the bases and Yardley’s cheering took on new
volume and stridency. Surely the game was won
now! With three on bases and only one man
down, things looked very good!</p>

<p>But when it was seen that the man up was Vinton,
the prospect didn’t appear quite so bright.
Vinton had shown that while he could play his
position at second to the King’s taste he was no
batter. Many wondered why Payson didn’t substitute
another player, one whose ability to bat
was proved. The truth is that Payson didn’t
dare to, as he explained afterwards. He expected
the game to run into extra innings and he had no
one amongst the substitutes who could hold down
second satisfactorily. So he chanced it, knowing
that even if Dan went out there was still Smith to
depend on.</p>

<p>Dan, when he realized the situation and what
was expected of him, rather wished for a moment
that Payson had taken him out. But that was
for a moment only. Then his fighting spirit arose
and he determined to show them that Payson
knew what he was about. So he faced Herring
with a fine assumption of confidence and so impressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
the latter that when the catcher called
for a straight ball he shook his head and tried a
drop instead. Dan was learning now, and the
drop didn’t deceive him. He let it go by and
heard the umpire say “Ball!” But the next delivery
caught him napping, and the score was
even. Then came something that looked just
about right, and Dan stepped forward and struck
it. But the ball went glancing back over the
stop and the umpire called “Foul! Strike two!”</p>

<p>Dan’s heart sank then. But outwardly he only
smiled grimly and took a firmer grip on the bat.
The next delivery was so palpably wide that Dan
didn’t even hesitate about refusing it. Then perhaps
Herring was impatient, for he sent a slow
ball that dropped ever so little as it neared the
plate, and Dan, with a sudden suffocating sensation
in his throat, swung at it hard. Bat and
ball met with a comforting sound that sent him
speeding down the line to first. High and far
went the ball. Dan rounded first and started
toward second. Then, realizing that he was
blocked, he slowed up and scampered back so as
not to be in the way of Millener if that player had
to return to first. That was a long fly, but Broadwood’s
center-fielder was under it as it came down,
and Dan was out.</p>

<p>Over on third, however, Alf was poised, one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
foot on the bag, ready to sprint for home as soon
as the ball touched earth or player. And the instant
center-fielder caught it Alf settled his head
between his shoulders and dug out for the plate.
In came the ball, center-fielder to shortstop, shortstop
to catcher, but it didn’t come quick enough
to keep Alf from scoring. He was over the base
and rolling out of the way amidst a cloud of dust
when the catcher swung for him. And down on
third Richards was watching hard for a chance
to follow Alf in, and on second Millener was dancing
exultantly about. Dan walked back to the
bench and into the arms of the players there.
They thumped him and shouted congratulations
into his ears. They had to shout, for the cheering
section was making such a noise that only
shouts could be heard even over here at the bench.
Dan grinned and sank into a seat. Danforth,
whom Dan had displaced at second and who had
been looking pretty glum all the afternoon,
reached over and shook hands smilingly. Then
came Alf and squeezed himself in beside Dan and
rumpled his hair and punched him and beamed
ecstatically. Meanwhile Smith was trying what
he could do. Two balls and then a shout of joy
as the ball arched up and away into left field dwindling
to silence as left-fielder pulled it down,
tossed away his glove and trotted in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span></p>

<p>The side was out and the score stood 4 to 3 in
Yardley’s favor. Cheered to the echo the blue-stockinged
players ran into the field. The day
was not yet won, and they all realized it. Some
of the enemy’s best batters were coming up and
if victory was to remain with the Blue it behooved
the latter’s warriors to battle grandly.</p>

<p>“Now, then, fellows!” cried Millener. “Buck
up, and get this over! Play the game!”</p>

<p>The last half began amidst such a pandemonium
of sound as hadn’t been heard on Broadwood
Field for years. Cheers for Yardley and cheers
for Broadwood met in midfield and clashed heavenward
in a mighty volume. Then, “Batter up,
please!” called the umpire, and the final struggle
was on.</p>

<p>Cross, the first of the foe to face Colton, was
an easy proposition and struck out miserably.
And Yardley acclaimed wildly. Then came Gale,
the Broadwood captain. He looked at once anxious
and determined. He found the first ball
thrown for a safe hit over shortstop. Then it
was Broadwood’s turn to shout, and she did it.
After Gale came the dangerous Little, and the
Yardley outfield fell further back. But although
Little hit, his effort was good for only one base.
Things began to look interesting now and Boudinot,
after lingering at the bench for several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
moments listening to instructions, stepped to the
plate with a gleam in his eye that put Colton on
his mettle.</p>

<p>For a minute or two it seemed that Colton had
taken his measure, for he worked two strikes on
him in succession. But after that Colton couldn’t
please the umpire and Boudinot walked to first
and filled the bases. If there had been pandemonium
before, what ensued is beyond any
language I know. Back of first and third the
Broadwood coachers were yelling themselves
hoarse. Colton was plainly nervous, so nervous
that he made the mistake of throwing to first in an
attempt to catch the runner there. That almost
proved disastrous, for Millener was not looking
for the throw, and only stopped it by a hair’s
breadth. If it had gone by, at least two men would
have scored and the game would have been lost
then and there. Richards walked down to the
box and talked a moment with Colton, finally clapping
him encouragingly on the shoulder before he
returned to his mask and mitt.</p>

<p>Broadwood’s next man was Kent, the shortstop.
He wasn’t big but he was spry and very
much in earnest. He smiled derisively at the first
ball and looked pained when the umpire called it
a strike. He even wanted to argue about it, but
the official refused to let him. So he gave his attention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
to Colton instead, looking quite incensed.
Colton sent in an exasperating in-shoot that
fooled Kent quite as fully as had the first delivery
and the umpire called:</p>

<p>“Strike two!”</p>

<p>Kent got madder still, so mad that he quite forgot
caution and stepped out after the next ball
and, contrary to all law, found it squarely on the
end of his bat. In raced the man on third, down
from second went the next runner, off for second
streaked the third, and away went Kent and the
ball simultaneously, the former for the first bag
and the latter, to all appearances, for somewhere
in right center-field. Broadwood leaped deliriously
and waved her banners. All this is what
the first moment saw. <a href="#i_frontis">The next saw a lad</a> poised
midway between first base and second and some
yards back of the line, <a href="#i_frontis">leap high into the air in the
path of the speeding ball</a>, saw the ball tip the upthrust
glove, bound into the air, and come down in
that same glove, saw the lad race to second and tag
that base, and saw Broadwood’s discomfiture and
defeat, Yardley’s ecstasy and victory!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Over on a corner of the Yardley bench the
scorer bent over his book while the crowds overflowed
the field. He was putting the finishing
touches to his work, and as he figured the last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
summary he smiled in contentment. Here is the
story the score-book told:</p>

<p>What a journey home in the automobile that
was! Mr. Pennimore, Gerald, Dan, Alf, and
Harry in the tonneau, and Tom beside the chauffeur!
How the blue flags snapped and fluttered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
their signal of victory as the big car ate up the
white road! How, as they rehearsed the struggle,
they always came back sooner or later to Dan’s
double play!</p>

<p>“Why, Dan,” declared Alf vehemently, “you
won that game just as much as though you had
made a home-run with the bases full! If you
hadn’t doubled then Broadwood would have
scored twice at least! Confound you, Dan, you’re
always doing some spectacular stunt and making
a blooming hero of yourself! Why can’t I be
a hero, I’d like to know? But you just wait until
next year. If I can’t find any other way of doing
it I’ll set fire to Dudley and rescue Tom in his
nightie from the devouring flames! I’ll be a hero
or perish!”</p>

<p>“So that,” inquired Mr. Pennimore when they
had ceased laughing at Alf’s sally, “is what
you call a ‘double play.’ Well, it strikes me, Dan,
that double plays are your forte.”</p>

<p>“That’s the first one I ever made, sir,”
answered Dan.</p>

<p>Mr. Pennimore smiled.</p>

<p>“Technically, yes, I dare say. But I wonder if
we can’t put the term ‘double play’ to a broader
interpretation. It seems to me, now, that anyone
who not only makes his own career successful
but finds time to look after the welfare of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
friend might very well be said to be making a
double play. What do you say, Mr. Dyer?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, you’re right,” answered Tom with
decision. “And that’s just what Dan’s done, as
we all know.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and here is one who knows it better than
the rest of us,” said Mr. Pennimore, with an affectionate
look at Gerald.</p>

<p>Gerald smiled and glanced shyly at Dan.</p>

<p>“I know one time when he made a double play,
and a bully one,” he affirmed amidst laughter.
“And that was when I tried to make a ‘steal for
home.’”</p>

<p>“And which,” added Mr. Pennimore, “unlike
most ‘double plays,’ instead of resulting in
a ‘put-out’ perhaps prevented one!”</p>

<p>And he chuckled quite as heartily as any one
at his joke.</p>

<p>Here, then, let us leave them for a time, speeding
home through the warm, amber glow of late
afternoon, the wind in their faces and joy in their
hearts, feeling as only boys can feel after a battle
bravely fought and a victory well won.</p>

<p>There is no boy in the country to whom the name of
Hobson does not bring a thrill of patriotic fire. A boy’s
story by this national hero is sure of an overwhelming reception.
Captain Hobson here shows himself a story-teller
of rare powers, and his book would captivate the young
reader whatever name was on its title-page. His name
adds new charm and conviction.</p>

<p>There has never before been so loyally and faithfully
depicted the routine and life of the naval cadet. Every
incident in this story of Buck’s career at the Naval Academy
has its foundation in fact, and in the author’s use of
them here they become revitalized. Nowhere else so well
as in this story can the young man, desirous of learning
how a cadet fares at Annapolis, obtain the information.
And in addition to all this Captain Hobson has told a
story brimful of interest and adventure, the love and
mystery of the sea, the fascination of boy life aboard ship
with other boys, and the friendships with old tars and
younger classmates.</p>

<p class="works">“Ranked among the most popular books for boys, not only because

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,

other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
